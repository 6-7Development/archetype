# Claude Sonnet 4 Advantage Strategy
## Why Archetype's Premium AI Justifies Higher Pricing
### Updated: October 16, 2025

---

## 🎯 **The Strategic Problem**

**Reality Check:**
- **Claude Sonnet 4 Cost:** $3.00 input / $15.00 output per 1M tokens
- **GPT-4 Turbo Cost:** $1.00 input / $3.00 output per 1M tokens
- **Cost Difference:** Claude is **5× more expensive** for output tokens

**Typical Project Generation:**
- Input: ~20,000 tokens ($0.06 Claude vs $0.02 GPT)
- Output: ~15,000 tokens ($0.225 Claude vs $0.045 GPT)
- **Total: $0.285 Claude vs $0.065 GPT (4.4× more expensive)**

**Competitor Pricing:**
- v0.dev: $20/mo (likely using GPT-4 or custom models)
- Cursor: $20/mo (GPT-4 Turbo)
- Replit AI: $20/mo (custom models + GPT)
- **Archetype Starter:** $39/mo (95% more expensive)

**The Question:** Why should customers pay 2× more for Archetype when competitors use cheaper AI?

**The Answer:** Because Claude Sonnet 4 delivers **enterprise-grade code quality** that cheaper models cannot match.
