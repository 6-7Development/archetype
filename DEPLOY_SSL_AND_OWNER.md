# Critical Production Fixes - SSL & Owner Setup

## 🔥 What's Being Fixed

### 1. SSL Certificate Errors (DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT)
**Problem**: Production database uses self-signed SSL certificates  
**Solution**: Configure Pool to accept self-signed certs

### 2. Owner Not Set
**Problem**: Platform healing requires an owner user  
**Solution**: SQL script to mark owner in production database

---

## 📦 Files Included in This Deploy

### server/db.ts
- ✅ SSL configured: `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }` in production
- ✅ Enhanced logging to show actual SSL config

### production-owner-setup.sql
- SQL script to mark owner user in production database
- Default email: `root@getdc360.com`
- Can be customized for your actual email

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Auto-Deploy (This Commit)
This commit triggers automatic deployment to Render with SSL fixes.

### Step 2: Set Database Owner (Manual - After Deploy)
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Database
2. Click "Access" → "Connect" 
3. Copy the `psql` connection command
4. Run in terminal, then execute:

```sql
-- Check existing admins
SELECT id, email, role, is_owner FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';

-- Mark your account as owner (change email to match your actual account!)
UPDATE users SET is_owner = true WHERE email = 'root@getdc360.com';

-- Verify
SELECT id, email, role, is_owner FROM users WHERE is_owner = true;
```

**OR** use the provided SQL file:
```bash
psql <connection-string> -f production-owner-setup.sql
```

---

## ✅ Expected Results

After this deployment:
- ✅ No more SSL certificate errors
- ✅ Database connects successfully
- ✅ Server starts without retries
- ⏳ Owner can be set via SQL (manual step)
- ✅ LomuAI will work once owner is set

---

## 🔍 How to Verify

### Check Logs for:
```
✅ [db] Pool config: connectionTimeoutMillis=5000, ssl=enabled (rejectUnauthorized: false)
✅ [db] SSL Configuration: {"rejectUnauthorized":false}
✅ Database connected successfully
```

### Should NOT see:
```
❌ DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT
❌ self-signed certificate
❌ Retry attempt X/5 failed
```

---

## 📞 Next Steps After Deploy

1. Wait for Render deployment to complete (~2-3 min)
2. Check logs for successful database connection
3. Run owner setup SQL if you need LomuAI access
4. Platform will be fully operational!
