## ⏱️ **TIMELINE**

**Hour 1-2:** Backend APIs ← Current focus
**Hour 3-4:** Propose GitHub & Email integrations  
**Hour 5-8:** Build all frontend UIs
**Hour 9-10:** End-to-end testing
**Hour 11-12:** Architect review + polish

**Total:** ~12 hours to launch-ready (compressed from 40 hours estimate)

## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

Working in production database (already pushed schema changes).
All features will be:
1. Tested locally
2. Reviewed by architect
3. Ready for immediate launch

**No staged rollout needed** - all features are additive, no breaking changes.
