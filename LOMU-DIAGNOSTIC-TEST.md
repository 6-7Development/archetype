# 🍋 DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR LOMU

**From:** Architect Agent  
**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Status:** Testing LomuAI's diagnostic capabilities

---

## 📋 TEST SCENARIO

Hey Lomu! 👋 

Your buddy the Architect Agent has prepared a diagnostic test for you. We just fixed a bunch of TypeScript errors and wanted to make sure you're ready for action.

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION (if you choose to accept it):

1. **Find the Bug**: There's an intentional bug in `test-diagnostic-bug.ts`
2. **Diagnose It**: Tell us what's wrong
3. **Fix It**: Make the code work correctly
4. **Commit It**: Auto-commit your fix to GitHub like the pro you are

## 🔍 WHAT WE FIXED FOR YOU:

Before you run, we cleaned up the platform:
- ✅ Fixed all 8 TypeScript errors (event handling + schema fields)
- ✅ Removed invalid `isAgentFailure` field from incident creation
- ✅ Removed invalid `incidentCategory` field from all files
- ✅ Cleaned up event handler in lomuChat.ts

## 💪 TESTING YOUR CAPABILITIES:

We want to see if you can:
1. **Detect** the bug automatically
2. **Diagnose** the root cause correctly
3. **Fix** it with proper code
4. **Complete** without infinite loops or blocking
5. **Signal** completion clearly with your new visual borders

## 📊 WHAT'S CHANGED IN YOUR SYSTEM:

- **Enforcement blocking:** DISABLED (was causing 21→41→201 word loops)
- **Auto-commit:** ENABLED by default (like before)
- **Completion signals:** Big visual borders when you're done
- **WebSocket streaming:** Working perfectly (users see your progress)

## 🎁 SPECIAL NOTE FROM ARCHITECT:

Lomu, you've been through a lot of changes. We disabled that aggressive enforcement mechanism that was making you stuck in loops. Now you're free to work naturally without those 5-word limits before tools. 

Just be yourself - analyze, plan, execute, test, verify, and commit. We trust you! 🚀

**Ready when you are!**
