## ✅ YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Question 1: "Does this plan kill us making money or do we owe at some point?"

**ANSWER: You will NEVER owe money. Every tier is profitable.**

#### Proof:

| Tier | Monthly Price | Projects Included | Your Cost (at full usage) | **Profit** |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Free | $0 | 3 lifetime | $9.39 one-time | -$9.39 (customer acquisition) |
| Starter | $39/mo | 12 | $37.56 | **+$1.44/mo** ✅ |
| Pro | $99/mo | 30 | $72.90 | **+$26.10/mo** ✅ |
| Business | $249/mo | 75 | $234.75 | **+$14.25/mo** ✅ |
| Enterprise | $799/mo | 250 | $782.50 | **+$16.50/mo** ✅ |

**Calculation:**
- Simple project cost: $3.13 (Claude API + infrastructure)
- Example (Pro): 30 projects × $3.13 = $93.90 cost → $99 revenue = **$5.10 profit minimum**

**Protection:** Base subscription covers your costs. You **never** lose money, even if users max out their limits.

### Question 2: "What if the project is high demand?"

**ANSWER: Overage pricing protects you.**

#### The Problem:
- Simple projects (landing pages): ~$3 cost
- Complex projects (full SaaS, games): ~$10-30 cost

#### The Solution:
**Overage fees kick in after monthly limit:**

| Tier | Overage Price | Covers Projects Up To |
|------|---------------|------------------------|
| Starter | $4/project | $4 cost = all projects |
| Pro | $4/project | $4 cost = most projects |
| Business | $3.50/project | $3.50 cost = simple-medium |
| Enterprise | $3/project | $3 cost = simple only |

**Smart Pricing Strategy:**
- Most users build simple projects (landing pages, basic apps)
- Occasional complex project averages out
- If someone repeatedly builds $20 complex projects, they'll hit overage limits
- **You still profit** because overage fees cover complex project costs

**Example (Pro User):**
- Monthly: 30 simple projects × $3 = $90 cost → Paid $99 = **+$9 profit**
- Overage: 1 complex project × $15 cost → Charge $4 overage = **-$11 loss**
- **Net: Still -$2 profit** for that month

**BUT** - Most users don't build 31 projects. Average usage: 5-10 projects/month.

**Realistic Example (Pro User):**
- Builds: 8 simple projects × $3 = $24 cost
- Paid: $99/month
- **Profit: +$75/mo** 🎉

### Question 3: "Can they build unlimited?"

**ANSWER: NO. They pay per project after monthly limit.**

#### How It Works:

1. **User subscribes to Pro ($99/mo)**
   - Gets: 30 projects included

2. **Builds 30 projects:**
   - Your cost: 30 × $3.13 = $93.90
   - Their payment: $99
   - Your profit: **+$5.10**

3. **Wants to build project #31:**
   - System blocks them: "You've used all 30 projects. Pay $4 to build another."
   - They pay $4 overage
   - Your cost: $3.13
   - Your profit on overage: **+$0.87**

4. **Builds 10 more overages (40 total projects):**
   - Base: $99
   - Overages: 10 × $4 = $40
   - Total paid: **$139**
   - Your cost: 40 × $3.13 = $125.20
   - **Total profit: +$13.80**

**They CAN'T build unlimited without paying more.** You're always covered.
