# Archetype Pricing Model V2.0 - Token-Based Complexity Pricing
## **80-90% Profit Margins with Fair, Transparent Pricing**

---

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM WITH V1.0:**

**Old Model (Project-Based):**
- Pro: $99/mo for 30 projects
- Cost: 30 × $3.13 = $93.90
- **Profit: $5.10 (5% margin)** ← TERRIBLE!

**Why it failed:**
- ❌ Gave away too many projects
- ❌ No differentiation between simple vs complex
- ❌ Users could abuse system with 30 complex projects
- ❌ Unsustainable margins (industry standard: 80-90%)

---

## ✅ **THE SOLUTION: TOKEN-BASED COMPLEXITY PRICING**

### **Key Innovation:**
**Charge based on what users ACTUALLY consume, not arbitrary project counts.**

---

## 💰 **NEW PRICING TIERS (Token Allowances)**

| Tier | Price | Tokens/Month | Simple Projects | Medium Projects | Complex Projects | Profit Margin |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 30,000 | 3-6 | 1-3 | 0-1 | N/A (acquisition) |
| **Starter** | $49/mo | 120,000 | 12-24 | 4-8 | 1-4 | **90%** |

| **Enterprise** | $899/mo | 3,000,000 | 300-600 | 100-200 | 30-100 | **87%** |

**Overage Pricing:** $1.50 per 1,000 tokens (80% profit margin)
