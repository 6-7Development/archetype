ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-key>
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
GITHUB_REPO=<owner/repo>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-key>

# NEW - Critical for webhook security (MUST GENERATE YOUR OWN)
WEBHOOK_SECRET=<generate-with-openssl-rand-hex-32>
```

### Optional (Recommended)
```bash
# Auto-healing control
ENABLE_AUTO_HEALING=true  # Enable in production
ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT=true   # Auto-commit fixes
ENABLE_AUTO_PUSH=true     # Auto-push to GitHub

# GitHub integration
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
OWNER_USER_ID=<your-user-id>  # For maintenance mode access

# OpenAI (for image generation if needed)
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>

# Stripe public key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-stripe-public-key>

# Deployment metadata
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up Railway Project
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to project
railway link
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Navigate to your service
- Add all required environment variables from above
- **IMPORTANT**: Generate a new `WEBHOOK_SECRET` using:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
  Then add it to Railway environment variables

### 3. Configure Database
- Add Neon PostgreSQL plugin in Railway
- Copy `DATABASE_URL` to environment variables
- Schema will auto-migrate on first deploy

### 4. Deploy
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# Or push to GitHub (if connected)
git push origin main
```

### 5. Configure Webhooks
**Railway Webhook Configuration:**
1. Generate webhook secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Add `WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Railway environment variables
3. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
4. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.railway.app/api/webhooks/deployment`
5. Add custom header: `x-webhook-signature` with the SAME secret value
6. **CRITICAL**: The secret MUST match in both Railway env vars and webhook config

**Render Webhook Configuration (if using):**
1. Use the SAME `WEBHOOK_SECRET` value from Railway environment
2. Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.onrender.com/api/webhooks/deployment`
4. Add custom header: `render-signature` with the secret value
5. **CRITICAL**: The secret MUST be identical across all platforms

### 6. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.railway.app/api/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T04:30:00.000Z",
  "database": "connected",
  "uptime": 1234
}
```

### 7. Create Owner Account
```bash
# SSH into Railway container or use Railway CLI
railway run bash

# Run owner setup script
npm run setup:owner
```

## üìä Post-Deployment Verification

### Test Core Features
- [ ] Login/authentication works
- [ ] Create a new project
- [ ] Chat with LomuAI works
- [ ] File editing and Monaco editor loads
- [ ] Preview system works
- [ ] Platform Healing UI accessible
- [ ] Deployment logs showing
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable

### Test Healing System
- [ ] Trigger a test incident
- [ ] Verify AI diagnosis runs
- [ ] Check confidence score calculated
- [ ] Confirm webhook received from Railway/Render
- [ ] Validate deployment status updated
- [ ] Review audit trail in database

### Monitor Performance
- [ ] Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Verify database connections stable
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Check WebSocket connection count
- [ ] Review Stripe webhooks working

## üõü Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check DATABASE_URL format
echo $DATABASE_URL
# Should be: postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require

# Test connection
npm run db:push
```

### Webhook Verification Failing
```bash
# Verify WEBHOOK_SECRET is set
railway variables

# Check webhook logs
railway logs

# Look for: [WEBHOOK-SECURITY] Invalid signature
```

### Build Failures
```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Verify all dependencies installed
npm install

# Check Railway build logs
railway logs --deployment
```

### Auto-Healing Not Running
```bash
# Verify environment variables
echo $ENABLE_AUTO_HEALING  # Should be: true
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY    # Should be: sk-ant-...
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN         # Should be set

# Check healing orchestrator logs
railway logs | grep "HEAL-ORCHESTRATOR"
```
