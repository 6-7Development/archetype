## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

### **Tip 1: Migrate Projects in Batches**

Don't try to migrate 50 projects at once:
- Start with your **3 most important** projects
- Make sure they work
- Then migrate the rest

---

### **Tip 2: Test Before Deleting from Replit**

- Import to Archetype ✅
- Test it works ✅
- Use it for a few days ✅
- THEN delete from Replit (save money!)

---

### **Tip 3: Use Project Switcher**

- You can have UNLIMITED projects in Archetype
- Use the dropdown to switch between them
- No 3-project limit like Replit Free!

---

### **Tip 4: Leverage AI Assistant**

- Click "AI" button while coding
- Ask: "Find bugs in this code"
- Ask: "Add error handling"
- Ask: "Optimize this function"
- **It's FREE!** (powered by Claude Sonnet 4)

---

### **Tip 5: Keep Dependencies in Version Control**

Going forward:
- Always commit `package.json` or `requirements.txt`
- Makes migration easier if you switch again
- Good practice anyway!

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **What Gets Migrated:**

✅ All your code files  
✅ Folder structure  
✅ File content  
✅ Project organization  

### **What DOESN'T Get Migrated:**

❌ Replit Secrets (you'll need to re-add them)  
❌ Environment variables (add them manually)  
❌ Installed packages (run `npm install` again)  
❌ Databases (export/import separately)  
❌ Deployed URLs (you'll get new Archetype URLs)  

**Solution:** Most of these take 2-5 minutes to reconfigure per project.

---

## 🎯 **MIGRATION CHECKLIST**

Use this for EACH project:

- [ ] Download ZIP from Replit
- [ ] Import to Archetype
- [ ] Test project runs
- [ ] Install dependencies (if needed)
- [ ] Add environment variables (if needed)
- [ ] Run project successfully
- [ ] Use for 3-7 days to confirm
- [ ] (Optional) Delete from Replit

---

## 🤝 **NEED HELP?**

If you get stuck:

1. **Check Console** (bottom panel) for error messages
2. **Read error carefully** - usually tells you what's wrong
3. **Try Terminal** - run install commands
4. **Ask AI Assistant** - click AI button, explain your issue
5. **Re-import** - sometimes just re-importing fixes it
