## üéØ TAX INFORMATION (Read First!)

### **Do You Need to Collect Tax?**

**SaaS IS taxable** in many jurisdictions:
- **US States**: 23+ states tax SaaS (varies by state)
- **EU**: 20% VAT required for EU customers
- **Canada**: GST/HST applies
- **UK**: 20% VAT applies

### **Stripe Tax (Recommended Setup)**

Stripe Tax automatically calculates and collects sales tax worldwide.

**How to Enable:**
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to **"Tax"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Get started"** or **"Set up"**
3. Choose your business location
4. Enable automatic tax collection
5. **Cost**: $0.50 per invoice + 0.5% of transaction (worth it for compliance!)

**Then for each product:**
- Set Tax behavior: **"Inclusive"** or **"Exclusive"** (see below)
- Set Product tax code: **"Software as a Service (SaaS)"** - Code: `txcd_10000000`

### **Tax Behavior Options:**

**Exclusive (Recommended):**
- Price shown: $49/mo
- Customer pays: $49 + applicable tax
- Example: California customer pays $49 + $4.68 tax = $53.68

**Inclusive:**
- Price shown: $49/mo
- Tax is already included in $49
- You receive less after tax deduction

üëâ **Use "Exclusive"** - customers expect to pay tax on top of advertised price

## üí∞ OVERAGE CHARGES - HOW THEY WORK

### **Important: Overages are NOT Stripe products!**

Your platform code (already implemented) handles overage billing:

1. **User subscribes to Starter** ($49/mo via Stripe)
2. **They use 300K tokens** (50K over their 250K limit)
3. **Archetype tracks overage**: 50K tokens √ó $0.10/1K = $5.00
4. **Overage stored in database** (usage_logs table)
5. **Monthly billing**: Next invoice = $49 + $5 overage = $54

### **Overage Rates (Already Configured in Code):**
```
Starter: $0.10 per 1,000 tokens
Pro: $0.08 per 1,000 tokens
Business: $0.06 per 1,000 tokens
Enterprise: $0.05 per 1,000 tokens
```

### **How Overage Billing Works:**

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended - Already Coded)**
- Archetype calculates overage at end of billing cycle
- Creates Stripe invoice item for overage charge
- Stripe adds it to next subscription invoice
- Customer pays subscription + overage in one charge

**Option 2: Manual Reporting**
- You review overage reports monthly
- Manually create invoices for large overage amounts
- More control, more work

üëâ **Your platform uses Option 1** - it's already coded in `server/usage-tracking.ts` and `server/stripe.ts`

### **No Additional Stripe Setup Needed for Overages!**

The subscription products you create are just the base plans. Overage billing happens automatically through:
- `usage_logs` table (tracks token usage)
- `checkUsageLimits()` function (calculates overages)
- Stripe API calls (creates invoice items)

---

## üîë API KEYS - WHERE TO FIND THEM

After creating all 4 products:

### **Step 1: Get API Keys**
1. In Stripe sidebar, click **"Developers"**
2. Click **"API keys"**
3. You'll see:

   **Publishable key** (safe for frontend):
   ```
   pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx (Test Mode)
   pk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx (Live Mode)
   ```
   
   **Secret key** (backend only - NEVER expose):
   ```
   Click "Reveal test key token" ‚Üí sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   Click "Reveal live key token" ‚Üí sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

### **Step 2: Copy All Values**

You'll have **6 values total**:

```bash
# API Keys (from Developers ‚Üí API keys)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Price IDs (from each product page)
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_STARTER=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BUSINESS=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ENTERPRISE=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
