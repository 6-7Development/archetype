# SySop Feature Status - What's Implemented vs Missing

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Working)

### Autonomous Tools
- **Browser Testing** (Playwright) - SySop can test generated code in real browser
- **Web Search** (Tavily API) - SySop can search docs and solutions in real-time
- **Vision Analysis** (Claude Vision) - SySop can analyze UI mockups and screenshots
- **Architect Consultation** - SySop can call expert architect when stuck

### Core Capabilities  
- **File Access** - SySop can read/write files in uploaded projects
- **Real-time Streaming** - Live progress via WebSocket
- **Teaching Emojis** - Beginner-friendly progress with üß†üî®‚úÖ icons
- **Secrets Management** - Secure API key handling
- **Usage Tracking** - Token counting and billing
- **Admin Unlimited Access** - root@getdc360.com has free unlimited use

### UI/UX
- **Workspace Navigation** - Header with logout, dashboard, home links
- **Project Upload** - ZIP file import with auto-redirect
- **Cost Preview** - Token estimation before generation
- **HTTPS Redirect** - Forces secure connections in production

## ‚ùå MISSING (Needs Implementation)

### Critical Missing Features

1. **Stop Button** - UI button exists but doesn't abort server-side generation
   - Current: Just hides progress locally
   - Need: API endpoint to abort running Anthropic stream

2. **Automatic Testing Loop** - Mentioned in docs but not enforced
   - Docs say: "MANDATORY after every code generation"
   - Reality: SySop doesn't auto-test after building
   - Need: Force browser_test after UI code, sample requests after API code

3. **Self-Correction Protocol** - Exists in prompt but not enforced
   - Docs say: "If tests fail, SySop fixes and retests; after 3 fails, calls architect"
   - Reality: Relies on Claude following instructions
   - Need: Server-side loop enforcement

4. **Real-time Progress Indicators** - Partial implementation
   - Missing: Live file count, lines changed, token counters
   - Missing: Collapsible progress sections per replit.md

5. **Project Templates** - Database schema exists, UI doesn't
   - Database has `templates` table
   - No template gallery or marketplace yet

## üîß PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

- **Progress Display**: Shows steps but missing work metrics (files created, lines changed)
- **Version Control**: Database schema exists, UI not built
- **Team Workspaces**: Database ready, collaboration UI missing
- **Publishing System**: Database exists, deployment UI incomplete

## üìã Priority Fixes Needed

1. **URGENT: Fix stop button** - Add abort controller system
2. **HIGH: Auto-test loop** - Enforce testing after code generation  
3. **HIGH: Self-correction** - Server-side retry logic with architect fallback
4. **MEDIUM: Enhanced progress** - Add metrics like Replit Agent (files, lines, tokens)
5. **MEDIUM: Template gallery** - Build UI for template marketplace
