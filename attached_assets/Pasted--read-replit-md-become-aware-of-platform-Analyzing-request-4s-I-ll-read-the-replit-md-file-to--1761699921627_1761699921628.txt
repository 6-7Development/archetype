Archetype - AI-Powered Website Builder Platform
Overview
Archetype is an AI-powered platform for rapid web development, featuring an AI coding agent (SySop) for autonomous code generation and dual-version IDE Workspaces (Archetype for desktop, Archetype5 for mobile). It offers a console-first interface, real-time preview, and comprehensive workspace features. Archetype aims for Fortune 500 production readiness and fully portable deployment, incorporating monetization infrastructure, a template marketplace, and professional development services. A key feature is Meta-SySop, an autonomous system for platform self-healing, bug fixes, and UI/UX improvements to its own source code, complete with rollback and audit logging.

User Preferences
API Configuration
Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic) for AI code generation
API key configured via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (latest Sonnet 4)
Superior code quality compared to GPT-4
Design Preferences
Fortune 500 corporate aesthetic
Professional enterprise design system
Navy blue and slate gray color palette
Card-based layouts with sophisticated shadows and elevation
Clean, minimalist interface with generous spacing
Professional Inter font family for UI
Dark mode with enterprise-grade polish
Subtle micro-interactions and hover effects
System Architecture
The platform is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

Dual-Version Architecture (Archetype + Archetype5)
The platform uses a unified codebase to support two distinct user experiences: Archetype (Desktop) with a 4-panel layout, and Archetype5 (Mobile) with bottom tab navigation. Both versions share backend APIs, WebSocket connections, authentication, and database access.

UI/UX Decisions
The user interface features a tab-based workspace (Overview, Build, Files, Preview, Activity, Versions) providing an IDE-like experience, primarily through a command console and real-time live preview. The design emphasizes a professional, corporate aesthetic with a navy/slate color palette, card-based layouts, smooth transitions, and ADA/WCAG accessibility. Chat interfaces are clean and minimal with enhanced progress displays. New additions include a visible image attachment toolbar in the AI chat interface and Resume/Cancel controls for Meta-SySop jobs. A real-time deployment status widget tracks GitHub commits and Meta-SySop's autonomous updates.

Technical Implementations
AI Architecture: SySop (AI Coding Agent) follows a 12-step workflow with Architect consultation, real-time streaming, and usage-based billing, optimized for full-stack web and professional games.
Replit Agent-Style Task Management: Live, interactive task lists with real-time status updates are displayed via a TaskBoard UI component, driven by WebSocket updates.
Autonomous AI System: SySop integrates self-testing (Playwright), web search (Tavily API), vision analysis (Claude Vision), architectural guidance (I AM), and an automatic reflection/self-correction loop. Meta-SySop includes enhanced tools like architect_consult, web_search, and commit_to_github.
Meta-SySop Autonomous Deployment: Meta-SySop diagnoses issues, consults I AM for approval, implements fixes, and automatically commits changes to GitHub, triggering auto-deployment. It operates in an action-oriented manner, prioritizing tool execution and code writing, with mechanisms to prevent analysis paralysis.
Meta-SySop Background Job System: Implemented a PostgreSQL-backed job queue for indefinite asynchronous execution, overcoming SSE timeout issues. Features include WebSocket broadcasting for real-time UI, resume capability for interrupted sessions, and complete checkpointing.
Meta-SySop Intimate Platform Knowledge System (Oct 28, 2025): Complete context awareness combining bounded conversation history (100 messages = ~50K tokens), condensed platform architecture knowledge, comprehensive bug/fix tracking across entire conversation, deployment awareness (last 10 GitHub commits), and conversational personality. Meta-SySop has intimate understanding of:
Every conversation with user (goals, issues, fixes, completed work)
Complete Archetype platform architecture (SySop, healing system, database, deployment)
All bugs fixed and features built throughout project history
Recent deployment updates and what changed
Technical implementation details and file structure
Full replit.md access: Can read/write platform documentation using readPlatformFile/writePlatformFile tools System uses token-bounded approach (100 messages + condensed knowledge) preventing API failures while maintaining comprehensive context. Memory system clearly labels historical issues as "RESOLVED" to prevent confusion about current platform state. Meta-SySop references this knowledge naturally in conversations like "I remember when we fixed X" or "Let me check the platform healing system I maintain".
Platform Healing System: Real-time system monitoring with WebSocket-based metrics broadcasting (CPU, memory, health, incidents, uptime, git status), a theme-aware UI, and auto-commit/auto-push toggles.
Advanced AI Capabilities: SySop can build complex marketplace platforms, 2D/3D games, implement usage-based billing, generate test data, simulate user behavior, and create functional chatbots/automation agents.
Command System: Natural language commands are processed by Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate JSON project structures.
File Management: Generated files are stored in PostgreSQL, editable via Monaco editor, with real-time WebSocket synchronization.
Conversational AI: AI assistant clarifies questions and explains design decisions with automatic summarization.
Preview System: Uses esbuild for in-memory React/TypeScript compilation to show applications in an iframe with real-time status and auto-refresh.
Performance Optimizations: Includes LRU caching, system prompt caching, Gzip compression, WebSocket memory leak fixes, and response caching.
Robust JSON Parsing Pipeline: A 3-tier extraction method for complex JSON structures from AI responses.
Multi-Agent Task Management System: Foundation for autonomous task breakdown with database tables and SySop tools.
SySop Diagnostic Tool: Enhanced perform_diagnosis for security-first, evidence-based diagnostics.
Feature Specifications
Workspace Features: Tab-based navigation, unified talk & build interface, Monaco editor, full project ZIP export.
Publishing/Deployment System: Publishing page with mobile-responsive design, database migration detection, deployment management, logs, and analytics.
Team Workspaces: Collaboration with role-based access, invitations, and shared project access.
API Key Management: Secure API key system for Pro+ users with hashing, usage tracking, and validation.
Support Ticketing: Complete system with subject, description, priority, status, and plan-based SLA.
AI Request Management: Priority processing queue with concurrent limits, real-time cost preview, usage dashboard, and token-based pricing.
Replit Agent-Style Features: Full implementation of advanced AI development features including:
Sub-Agent/Task Runner System: Parallel task execution with worker pool management.
Message Queue: Smart request queueing for follow-up tasks.
Autonomy Controls: Four-tier autonomy system controlling AI agent permissions.
AI Image Generation: Integration with OpenAI's gpt-image-1.
Dynamic Intelligence: Extended thinking mode for complex problems.
Plan Mode: Brainstorming and planning without code modification.
Design Mode: Visual prototyping and design system builder.
Workflows: Parallel and sequential command execution engine.
Agents & Automations: Template marketplace for bots, scheduled tasks, and webhooks.
General Agent Mode: Multi-project-type support beyond web apps.
Agent Features Dashboard: Unified /agent-features page with multiple feature tabs.
