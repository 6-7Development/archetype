Copilot said: Got it — you want the repo
Got it — you want the repo repaired so a “meta sysop” can edit the platform and have changes pushed and deployed to Railway automatically. I’ve drafted a clear, safe plan and sample automation you can add to the repo. Before I make changes, I need a little info and (if you want me to push files) repo permissions / secrets. Below I explain the plan, what I recommend, security implications, and I include ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows + a small helper script you can add.

Summary plan (recommended)

Add a Railway deployment workflow that runs on push to main (or chosen branch) and uses the Railway CLI / API to deploy.
Add a “meta-sysop edit” workflow that allows an authorized user (meta sysop) to trigger edits that the workflow will commit and push automatically using a stored bot PAT. The trigger options are:
issue_comment with a specific command (e.g., /meta-edit), or
repository_dispatch, or
manual workflow_dispatch from Actions UI.
Store required secrets in GitHub repo secrets:
RAILWAY_TOKEN (Railway API token)
RAILWAY_PROJECT (Railway project id if needed)
BOT_PAT (personal access token for committing/pushing; must have repo scope)
OPTIONAL: BOT_NAME, BOT_EMAIL
Note on protected branches: GitHub’s GITHUB_TOKEN cannot bypass branch protection rules that require status checks or restrict who can push. If you want automatic pushes to a protected branch, you will likely need to use BOT_PAT and permit that bot user (or the meta sysop account) to push to the branch via repo settings or allow actions from the bot. I’ll explain those steps below.
Security / governance notes

Using a PAT with repo scope grants strong access. Limit the PAT to a dedicated machine/bot account, store it in Secrets, and rotate it if the account is compromised.
If you prefer safer flow, require meta sysop pushes create a PR and have the repo’s CI/CD auto-merge on passing checks instead of allowing direct force-pushes to main.
What I’m about to provide here (and can add to repo if you want)

A Railway deploy workflow (.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml) — runs on push to main and deploys to Railway.
A meta-sysop edit workflow (.github/workflows/meta-sysop-edit.yml) — triggered by issue comment command or manual dispatch; it runs a script that applies edits and commits/pushes using BOT_PAT.
A small script scripts/commit-and-push.sh that commits local changes and pushes them back to the repo using the PAT.
If you want, I can push these files to the repository now — I will need permission to write and you must provide repository secrets (at least BOT_PAT and RAILWAY_TOKEN). If you prefer I can create a PR instead.

GitHub Action: Railway deploy (on push to main)

GitHub Action: meta-sysop edit & auto-commit (trigger by issue_comment or manual)

.github/workflows/meta-sysop-edit.yml
# Allows a trusted user to trigger a workflow that applies changes and commits/pushes them back.
# Triggers:

  remote_url="https://x-access-token:${BOT_PAT}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git"
  # Push branch
  git push "$remote_url" "HEAD:${TARGET_BRANCH}"
  echo "Pushed changes to ${TARGET_BRANCH}"
else
  echo "No changes to commit"
fi
How to enable and configure (step-by-step)

Create a dedicated bot account (recommended). Generate a PAT with repo scope and add as repository secret named BOT_PAT. Alternatively, use a machine user you control.
Add secrets to the repository:
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
RAILWAY_TOKEN (Railway API token)
RAILWAY_PROJECT (optional)
BOT_PAT
Optionally BOT_NAME and BOT_EMAIL
If you want direct pushes to protected branches:
In repo Settings → Branches, add the bot user as allowed to push, or adjust branch protection to allow Actions or the specific bot to bypass restrictions.
Alternatively, have the workflow push to a staging branch and auto-create a PR; then merge via GH API if desired.
Add the files above into the repository (path exactly as shown) or let me push them for you.
Test by triggering a manual workflow_dispatch run or by posting an issue comment containing /meta-edit (if using issue_comment trigger).
Edge cases and notes

If branch protection requires status checks, an action’s push with a PAT can still be blocked unless the pushing user is exempt. Review branch protection settings and allow the bot user or adjust settings accordingly.
If you need to restrict who can run the workflows, you can add logic in the workflow to check github.actor (the user who triggered) and only run when actor equals the meta sysop username.
If Railway needs a different deployment flow (like Docker build + railway up), adapt the deploy step to match your project’s needs.
Next steps

Tell me:
Do you want me to create these files in the repo now (I will need permission to push and you must create the BOT_PAT and RAILWAY_TOKEN secrets first), or
Do you want me to open a PR with these changes instead?
Confirm the meta sysop username (the GitHub login) and the target branch (main, production, etc).
If you want me to push now, provide the secrets (BOT_PAT, RAILWAY_TOKEN) via repo settings or confirm you’ll add them and then I’ll push the files and enable workflows.
If you prefer, I can instead produce a version that:

Uses repository_dispatch (so you can call via API),
Or creates PRs instead of direct pushes,
Or restricts execution to a single GitHub username.
Tell me which option you prefer and whether you want me to push these files into 6-7Development/archetype now.
