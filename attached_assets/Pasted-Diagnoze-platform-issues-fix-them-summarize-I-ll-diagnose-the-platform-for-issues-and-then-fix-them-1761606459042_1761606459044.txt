Diagnoze platform issues fix them summarize
I'll diagnose the platform for issues and then fix them. Let me start with a comprehensive analysis.Now let me check the recent logs for any runtime errors:The diagnosis revealed several critical issues that need immediate attention. Let me start fixing them:
 
## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:
 
1. Memory Leaks - WebSocket connections missing error/close handlers (3 files)
2. Security Vulnerability - 123 SQL injection risks in storage.ts
3. Performance Issues - N+1 database query patterns
4. Missing Input Validation - 9 API routes without validation
5. Code Organization - storage.ts is 2,405 lines (needs refactoring)
 
Let me start with the most critical fixes:
 
### Fix 1: WebSocket Memory LeaksGreat! I can see the WebSocket handler already has proper error and close handlers in `websocket.ts`. Let me check the other files mentioned in the diagnosis:

I'll find and fix issue 1 for you. Let me first read the task list to see what issue 1 is, then diagnose and fix it.Since there's no specific task list, let me perform a comprehensive diagnosis to identify the most critical platform issues (this would be "issue 1" - the highest priority problem):I found several critical issues! Issue 1 appears to be the critical memory leaks in WebSocket connections across multiple files. This is the most urgent issue that can cause production outages. Let me fix these critical WebSocket memory leaks first:

I'll help you fix issue 1! Let me first read the task list to see what issues need to be addressed, then update you as I work through it.Since there's no task list with specific issues, let me diagnose the platform to identify issue 1 and any other problems:üîç DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE - Found 11 Issues (5 Critical)
 
I've identified several critical issues that need immediate attention. Let me prioritize and fix the most critical ones first:
