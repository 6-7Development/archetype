Okay, I'll adjust the chat screen. First, I need to find the relevant files. I'm looking for the files related to the chat screen. I'll start by listing files in the client/src/pages directory to find potential chat components.I'm looking for the chat screen files. I've checked client/src/pages and didn't find anything directly related to chat. Now I'm checking client/src/components as chat components are likely to be there.I've checked the client/src/pages and client/src/components directories. ai-chat.tsx, ai-chat-panel.tsx, and lomu-chat.tsx appear to be the most relevant files for the chat screen. I'll begin by looking at lomu-chat.tsx.I'm looking at lomu-chat.tsx to adjust the chat input position. I've identified the div containing the input with sticky bottom-0 styling. I'll modify this to move the input higher.I'm looking at client/src/components/lomu-chat.tsx to adjust the chat input's position. I'll modify the padding of the input container to move it higher.
