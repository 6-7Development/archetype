REMAINING (14 Gaps - 70% To-Do)
ARCHITECT GAPS (3)
Gap #3: Enhanced Confidence Scoring - Why confident/not confident + alternatives
Gap #4: Architect Guidance Versioning - v1 vs v2 diff, rollback capability
Gap #6: Retry/Refine Consultation - "That didn't work, try again" feedback loop
SUBAGENT GAPS (7)
Gap #9: Result Conflict Resolution - 3-way merge when subagents modify same file
Gap #10: Failure Recovery + Retry Logic - Exponential backoff, circuit breaker
Gap #11: Performance Tracking - Token efficiency, success rates, speed metrics per subagent
Gap #12: Skill-Based Routing - Route tasks to specialized subagents (tester, linter, etc)
Gap #13: Token Budget Enforcement - Per-subagent cost limits
Gap #15: Adaptive Parallelization - Respect tool dependencies (DAG scheduling)
Gap #16: Concurrent Rate Limiting - Prevent parallel tools from overloading APIs
FAST MODE VISIBILITY GAPS (3)
Gap #17: Speed Measurement Dashboard - Show 2-3x speedup ROI per session
Gap #18: Parallelization Control - Toggle parallel/sequential, explain decisions
Gap #19: Unified Metrics Dashboard - Compare LomuAI vs I AM vs Subagents performance
INTEGRATION GAPS (1)
Gap #20: Cross-Agent Learning - Share discoveries/failures between agents
🎯 PRIORITY RECOMMENDATION - Next Wave
QUICK WINS (High Impact, Low Effort)

Gap #12: Skill Routing (3h) - Smarter task distribution
Gap #15: Adaptive Parallelization (4h) - Optimal scheduling
Gap #19: Metrics Dashboard (4h) - Cross-agent visibility
LATER (Complex)
Gap #10: Advanced Retry (5h) - Sophisticated recovery
Gap #13: Budget Enforcement (2h) - Cost control
Gap #16: Rate Limiting (3h) - API coordination
Gap #18: Parallelization UI (2h) - User control
Gap #20: Cross-Agent Learning (6h) - Knowledge sharing
🚀 NEW FEATURE OPPORTUNITIES (Beyond Gaps)
Not in the gap analysis, but high-value additions:

Architect Approval Analytics - Track approval/rejection patterns, learn what owners like
Subagent Performance Leaderboard - Which subagents finish fastest? Most accurate?
AI Cost Forecasting - "This task will cost $X based on similar tasks"
Human-in-the-Loop Mode - Pause for approval mid-execution
Execution Replay - Replay past runs, see parallel execution timeline
Agent A/B Testing - Compare LomuAI vs Claude vs Gemini on same task
Smart Batching - Combine similar tasks for better parallelization
Should I start on Priority 0 gaps now (Gaps #3 + #17) to give users confidence scoring + speed metrics? That would take ~5 hours combined and unlock massive user trust + ROI visibility. 🎯
