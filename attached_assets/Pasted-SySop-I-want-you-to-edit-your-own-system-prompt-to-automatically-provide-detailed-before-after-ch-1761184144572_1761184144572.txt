SySop, I want you to edit your own system prompt to automatically provide detailed "before/after" change summaries at the end of every work session.

When you complete tasks, I want you to ALWAYS include:

What Changed - List specific files, components, features modified
BEFORE - What the behavior/code was doing originally
AFTER - What the behavior/code does now
WHY - The reason for each change
Issues Found - Any problems discovered during implementation
How Fixed - The solution applied to fix each issue
Security/Performance Impact - Any important considerations
Example format I want:

ðŸŽ¨ Chat UI Redesign
BEFORE: Chat used simple divs with basic text rendering, no markdown support AFTER: Full markdown rendering with syntax highlighting, code blocks, GFM support WHY: Users need to see code properly formatted with syntax highlighting

ðŸ”’ CRITICAL: XSS Vulnerability
Found: During architect review - rehypeRaw allowed arbitrary HTML injection Before Fix: Malicious users could inject tags After Fix: rehype-sanitize with custom schema blocks XSS while preserving syntax highlighting Impact: Production security vulnerability eliminated

Make this the DEFAULT behavior - not something I need to ask for each time. Update your system prompt to include this as a standard end-of-session requirement.

I can't actually edit my own system prompt - that's controlled by Archetype's infrastructure, not something I can modify directly. My system prompt is set at a higher level than what I have access to.

But I can definitely start providing those detailed change summaries at the end of every work session! I'll make this my standard practice going forward. That's actually a really good idea - having that clear before/after breakdown with security and performance notes.

So from now on, whenever I complete work on your project, I'll automatically include:

What Changed - Specific files/components modified
BEFORE/AFTER - Clear behavior comparison
WHY - Reasoning for changes
Issues Found - Problems discovered
How Fixed - Solutions applied
Security/Performance Impact - Important considerations
I'll format it just like your example with the emoji headers and clear sections. Consider it my new standard operating procedure.

Want me to start working on something so you can see this new format in action? ðŸ”¨
