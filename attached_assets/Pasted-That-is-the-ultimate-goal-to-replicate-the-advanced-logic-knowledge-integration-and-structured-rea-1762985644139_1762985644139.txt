That is the ultimate goal—to replicate the advanced logic, knowledge integration, and structured reasoning that makes models like Gemini so effective.Since Lomu is powered by Gemini 2.5, the key is to fully leverage the model's native capabilities for reasoning and structured thought.Here is the advanced advice for making Lomu work and think like a Gemini 2.5 agent:💡 1. The Core: Maximizing Gemini 2.5's ReasoningGemini 2.5 models are explicitly designed with an internal "thinking process" that goes beyond simple Chain-of-Thought (CoT).1 You need to configure the API to leverage this.2Implement Dynamic Thinking Budget (thinkingBudget):The thinkingBudget parameter allows the model to use internal reasoning tokens before generating the final response.3For an agent like Lomu, set thinkingBudget = -1 (dynamic thinking). This allows the model to allocate reasoning tokens based on the complexity of the query.4 For simple tasks (e.g., "Add 2+2"), it is fast. For complex coding tasks, it spends the necessary tokens on self-correction and planning, mimicking deep thought.Configuration Snippet (Conceptual):Pythonconfig = types.GenerateContentConfig(
    # ... other configs
    thinking_budget=-1  # Dynamic thinking for best performance
)
Enable Thought Summaries (includeThoughts):You can request the model's internal thought process to be returned as part of the API response.5How it helps Lomu: By reading the thought summary, you can see WHY Lomu chose a certain path or WHERE his logic failed. You can use this for better debugging and iterating on your initial system prompt.🧠 2. Knowledge Integration (RAG-like Strategy)Lomu's "knowledge" is primarily his training data, but for coding, he needs immediate access to your project-specific knowledge (architectural constraints, specific library versions, etc.).Create a GEMINI.md or LOMU_CONTEXT.txt File:Before every major agent session or task, prepend the current project context to the prompt history. This acts as Lomu's short-term, project-specific knowledge base.Content to Include:Required Python version (e.g., Python 3.11)6Mandatory/Forbidden libraries (e.g., MUST use FastAPI, DO NOT use Flask.)Architecture rules (e.g., All database logic must reside in a file named 'db_layer.py')Current directory structure (e.g., Current working directory contains: main.py, config.json, tests/)Use Internet Search for Fresh Knowledge:Since LLM training data is "frozen," enable the Google Search tool only for technical questions requiring up-to-date information, such as:"What is the latest syntax for Python's asyncio?""What is the newest deprecation warning for pandas 2.0?"System Instruction: "Use web search only to verify syntax, check for version compatibility, or find official documentation for third-party libraries."⚙️ 3. Advanced Agent Logic (Self-Correction & Reflection)To ensure Lomu operates with consistent logic, integrate these concepts into the system prompt:ConceptDescription for Lomu's System PromptRecursive Self-ImprovementMandate a process of reviewing generated code before final output.Defensive CodingForce Lomu to consider potential real-world failures.Clarity over ClevernessPrioritize code readability for a human developer.System Prompt Additions (Refined)Reflection Step: "After generating any code block that is longer than 10 lines, you MUST perform an internal 'CRITIQUE': Check the code for (a) edge-case failures, (b) PEP 8 violations, and (c) security vulnerabilities. Only provide the code after the critique passes."Logic Mandate: "Every function you write must include robust error handling (e.g., try...except blocks) for predictable runtime issues like file not found, network timeouts, or invalid user input.7 This is a core part of your logic."Human Alignment: "Your code should be optimized for readability and maintainability by a mid-level Python developer. Avoid overly dense or 'clever' one-liners if a multi-line, clear approach is safer and easier to debug."By combining the powerful Gemini 2.5 thinking architecture with structured prompting and a project-specific knowledge context, you will create a Lomu that approaches problems with human-like reasoning and knowledge depth.
