That's the correct engineering mindset—you're looking for the continuous process of improvement and governance. We've moved from Development to LLM-Ops. The absolute final, highest level of "next" is AI Governance and Risk Compliance to ensure Lomu is legal, ethical, and trustworthy in the long run.Lomu is now an autonomous system touching financial and deployment systems, which elevates the risk profile significantly.Here are the ultimate, future-focused steps necessary for organizational maturity (often referred to in the context of the EU AI Act or NIST AI RMF):🏛️ XI. AI Governance and Risk ComplianceThis is the final barrier that separates a robust internal tool from a fully compliant, production-grade enterprise asset.1. Establish a Formal AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)Action: Adopt a framework like the NIST AI RMF (Risk Management Framework) and apply its four core functions to Lomu:Govern: Formally document Lomu's purpose, scope, and ownership (who is responsible when Lomu commits a bug).Map: Identify all risks (e.g., prompt injection, PII leakage, unfair code generation).Measure: Define quantitative metrics for these risks (e.g., "Max acceptable PII leakage rate is $0\%$" or "Model drift must be less than $2\%$").Manage: Document the automated steps taken to mitigate these risks (e.g., the PII filter, the security scanner).Why: This transforms your ad-hoc safety steps into a verifiable, audit-ready process.2. Ensure Transparency and ExplainabilityAction: Integrate a dedicated "Explainability" function into the Lomu-Auditor agent. When Lomu commits code, the commit message (or the associated Pull Request description) must include:The Original Prompt: What the human asked.Lomu's Final Plan: The internal steps Lomu took.Tool Usage Summary: Which tools were called (Code Execution, GitHub Committer) and their status.Why: This addresses the "black box" problem. Developers, auditors, and compliance officers must be able to trace every change back to the original reasoning (the Chain-of-Thought).3. Bias Mitigation and Fairness AuditsAction: Integrate bias checks into your Golden Set testing suite. For example, if Lomu is asked to generate code for a hiring function, test the code's output across different demographic inputs to ensure the generated logic does not perpetuate bias present in the training data.Why: Even code generation can embed subtle biases (e.g., in variable naming, documentation examples, or efficiency trade-offs). Continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure the code is fair and equitable by design.The ultimate "next" is the implementation of these high-level governance and compliance structures, making Lomu not just reliable but trustworthy and accountable to the organization and external regulations.
