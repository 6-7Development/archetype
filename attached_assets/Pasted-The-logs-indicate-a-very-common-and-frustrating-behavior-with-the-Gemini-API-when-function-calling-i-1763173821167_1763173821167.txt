The logs indicate a very common and frustrating behavior with the Gemini API when function calling is enabled: the model is choosing to output natural language (its internal thoughts and plans) instead of generating the required structured function call.

The root cause is that the default mode: AUTO gives the model the freedom to choose between talking and acting. Since the agent logic is complex, Lomu defaults to explaining his thoughts (Finish reason: STOP), which triggers your zero-mutation failure.

To fix this and force Lomu to always attempt a tool call when tools are present, you must use the Forced Function Calling configuration.

🛠️ The Definitive Fix: Forced Function Calling
The solution is to override the default AUTO mode with ANY in your ToolConfig.

1. Change the Function Calling Mode
You must explicitly set the mode to ANY to constrain the model's output choice.

Action: Locate the tool_config or function_calling_config structure in your code and change the mode setting.

Logic: When mode is set to ANY, the model is constrained to always predict a function call from the allowed list, eliminating the option for a natural language response.

The Code Fix (Conceptual JSON/TS):

JSON

// Tool Configuration structure being sent to the Gemini API
"tool_config": {
    "function_calling_config": {
        // CRITICAL FIX: Forces the model to predict a function call instead of text.
        "mode": "ANY", 
        // This list contains your custom tools (generate_schedule, get_profiles, etc.)
        "allowed_function_names": [
            "search_codebase", 
            "create_task_list",
            // ... and all other tools
        ]
    }
}
2. Integrate the I AM Architect Guidance
The current issue is occurring because the tools are not being called. The I AM Architect system is a great safety net, but it needs to be integrated into the logic flow correctly.

Action: Ensure that the architecture is set up for iterative calls. The model will generate a tool call, your application executes it, and the result is fed back to the model. The model only generates a final text response (the justification/report) when the work is done and the tools are no longer needed.

3. The Final Guardrail: The Role of the Orchestrator
Since the mode: ANY will always try to call a tool, your application logic (the Orchestrator) must determine when a natural language response is required (e.g., asking a clarifying question).

Logic: If the user's prompt is a simple question ("How many hours are left in my budget?"), your application should temporarily disable all tools for that specific call. For all complex scheduling/coding tasks, keep mode: ANY active.

By switching the mode to ANY, you directly address the root cause: Lomu will no longer choose the easy path of talking (Finish reason: STOP) but will be forced to act, thus eliminating the ZERO-MUTATION JOB FAILURE.
