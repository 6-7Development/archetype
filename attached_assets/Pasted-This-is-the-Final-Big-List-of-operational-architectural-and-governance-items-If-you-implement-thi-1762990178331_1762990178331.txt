This is the Final Big List of operational, architectural, and governance items. If you implement this entire checklist, you will have a production-grade, highly reliable, and compliant LLM agent.We've moved from building Lomu to sustaining Lomu.I. 🧠 Agent Architecture & Core Logic (Final Tuning)ItemAction RequiredWhy It's CriticalModel CascadeProgram Lomu Prime to dynamically select the model: Flash for simple code/low-cost; Pro for architectural planning and security analysis.Maximizes cost efficiency without sacrificing complexity, directly impacting ROI.Structured RAG (Agentic RAG)Implement an advanced retrieval tool that allows Lomu to ask the RAG system follow-up questions (multi-hop search) about the codebase.Prevents Lomu from generating code that violates project-specific constraints buried deep in documentation.Pydantic Schema EnforcementStrictly enforce the use of a JSON output schema (Plan, Code, Test) using the Gemini API's function calling feature to prevent the agent from producing unparsable text.Guarantees machine-readability and prevents the entire workflow from breaking due to conversational text.II. 🛠️ Tool & CI/CD Integration (Security Gates)ItemAction RequiredWhy It's CriticalCode Security ScanningIntegrate an open-source static analysis tool (e.g., Bandit for Python) into Lomu's workflow. Lomu must run the scanner after code_execution but before github_committer.Acts as the final Security Quality Gate. Catches common vulnerabilities that unit tests miss.Principle of Least PrivilegeEnsure the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) Lomu uses only has permissions to write code to the single repository he is managing and only to feature branches (not main).Contains damage in the event of an adversarial attack or runaway loop, protecting your entire GitHub account.Idempotency and RollbacksEnsure the github_committer tool always works by creating a new, uniquely named branch for every fix. Implement an easy @ROLLBACK command for the user to quickly revert the last commit via the GitHub API.Guarantees that Lomu's actions don't leave the project in an unrecoverable state after a failure.III. 📊 LLM-Ops & Governance (Long-Term Trust)ItemAction RequiredWhy It's CriticalFull Trace LoggingImplement a logging system that captures every single step of the agent's run: the prompt, the internal thought, the raw tool call, and the token count.Essential for debugging and auditability. You need to know why Lomu made a decision when a bug is committed.Token Budget EnforcementUse the logged token count to enforce a session budget (e.g., 50k tokens max per task). The application layer must terminate the session when the budget is reached.Prevents cost overruns and avoids performance degradation from excessive context window filling.Transparency and ExplainabilityLomu's commit message/Pull Request description must include: 1) The original user prompt and 2) Lomu's final plan (the Chain-of-Thought).Builds user trust and provides the necessary context for human code reviewers to quickly validate the changes.Golden Set TestingMaintain a suite of complex, multi-step tasks with known correct answers. Run Lomu against this suite on a scheduled basis (e.g., daily).Prevents model drift. Ensures Lomu doesn't forget how to solve old problems after you update his system prompt or the underlying Gemini model is updated.
