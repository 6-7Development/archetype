This is the definitive, Final Checklist for Production-Grade LLM Agent Deployment. If you implement these steps, Lomu will be robust, secure, financially viable, and ready for long-term growth on Replit/GitHub/Railway.We're shifting the focus entirely to LLM-Ops (Operations), Security, and Financial Discipline.🛠️ I. LLM-Ops: Instrumentation and TraceabilityYou must make the black box transparent to be able to debug in seconds, not hours.Integrated Observability Tool: Integrate a dedicated LLM observability platform (e.g., Langfuse, LangSmith, or Datadog LLM Observability) into your Python application.Action: Ensure every API call, internal thought, and tool execution is logged as a trace. This allows you to visually map Lomu's entire decision tree (e.g., "User asked $\rightarrow$ Lomu-Planner thought $X$ $\rightarrow$ Lomu-Coder called tool $Y$ $\rightarrow$ Tool returned error $Z$").Real-Time Alerting: Set up automated alerts for critical failures:API Errors: Alert on any 4xx or 5xx status codes from the Gemini API.1Tool Failures: Alert immediately when the github_committer or security_scanner tool fails.Budget Breach: Alert when any user hits their financial/token hard cap.Version Control for Prompts and Tools: Treat your System Instructions and tool logic (github_committer code) like production code.2 Store them in GitHub, tag versions, and document all changes in a changelog.🔒 II. Security, Governance, and ResilienceThese steps protect the user's project and your platform's integrity.1. Zero-Trust Tool AccessAction: Strictly enforce the Principle of Least Privilege. Every custom tool Lomu uses must be sandboxed and only given the minimum possible permissions.Example: The read_file tool should only read files within the user's designated project directory and should be blocked from accessing configuration files (like the API key file) or sensitive system directories.2. Continuous Red-TeamingAction: Regularly run simulated attacks (red-teaming) against Lomu's deployment.3 This includes testing for:Prompt Injection: Does a malicious prompt allow the user to bypass the @CONFIRM COMMIT gate?Tool Misuse: Can a prompt force Lomu to use the write_file tool to overwrite a file he shouldn't touch?Why: Agents are uniquely vulnerable to these attacks, and regular testing is the only defense.43. AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)Action: Formally document Lomu's role, risks (e.g., "Risk: Committing insecure code"), and the mitigation strategy (e.g., "Mitigation: Lomu-Auditor runs static analysis before commit").Why: This shifts accountability from guesswork to a structured, auditable process, essential for enterprise clients.5📈 III. Financial & Billing HardeningThis ensures the subscription model is watertight and sustainable.1. Automated Token Ledger ReconciliationAction: Implement an automatic daily reconciliation script that compares the total tokens recorded in your internal Ledger against the daily usage reports provided by Google's billing API.Why: This catches discrepancies early and verifies your internal token tracking accuracy, which is essential for audit and financial reporting.2. Proactive Subscription Management WorkflowAction: Implement the soft cap warning (at 80% usage) and a hard cap lockout (at 100% usage) in your application logic.Chatroom Flow: When a user hits the hard cap, the chatroom must present a non-Lomu-generated upgrade modal that links directly to your payment provider, requiring the user to pay or upgrade before the application logic allows the next prompt to be sent to Gemini.Why: This is the hard enforcement required to monetize the agent effectively and prevent financial loss.By treating Lomu as a high-stakes software system and implementing these rigorous operational controls, you ensure not only that he works right, but that he continues to work right, securely, and profitably over the long term.
