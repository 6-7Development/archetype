Tier 1: Foundational Autonomy & Intelligence (Must-Haves for Self-Healing)
This tier focuses on making your core claim of being "autonomously self-healing" a verifiable reality. It moves the AI from being reactive to being proactive, intelligent, and safe.

1. Proactive Health & Anomaly Detection:

Need: The AI must not wait for crashes. It should constantly monitor application logs and performance metrics (API latency, memory usage).
Feature: An AI-driven monitoring system that automatically opens an investigation when it detects a performance regression or an anomaly, before it becomes a user-facing error.
2. Comprehensive Validation & Automated Testing:

Need: To guarantee a "heal" is safe.
Feature: The AI must be able to automatically generate and run a targeted suite of tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end via Playwright) to rigorously verify that its fix has not introduced regressions.
3. Intelligent Root Cause Analysis (RCA):

Need: To fix problems permanently, not just patch symptoms.
Feature: The AI should be able to trace errors back to their source. If it sees a null value in the UI, it should investigate the API that sent it and the database query behind that, fixing the problem at its origin.
4. Automated Security & Dependency Management:

Need: The platform must protect and maintain itself over time.
Feature: A scheduled AI task that regularly runs security audits (npm audit) and checks for outdated dependencies. The AI will then automatically attempt to apply patches or updates, validate them with the test suite, and create a pull request or commit the fix.
5. Persistent & Evolving Knowledge Base:

Need: To ensure the AI is efficient, learns from experience, and never wastes money solving the same problem twice.
Feature: Migrate the AI's in-memory "knowledge base" to a persistent PostgreSQL database. The AI will store error signatures, successful fixes, test results, and confidence scores, turning expensive analysis into a cheap database lookup on subsequent encounters.
6. Confidence Scoring & Human-in-the-Loop Fallback:

Need: To build trust and handle high-risk changes safely.
Feature: After proposing a fix, the AI must calculate a confidence score. If the score is below a configurable threshold (e.g., 95%), it must not commit the fix. Instead, it will automatically create a pull request assigned to you, clearly documenting its proposed fix and why its confidence is low.
Tier 2: World-Class AI Persona & User Experience (Lomu's Evolution)
This tier focuses on transforming your AI, "Lomu," from a functional tool into a polished, intelligent collaborator that users trust and enjoy interacting with.

7. Advanced Context & State Management:

Need: To stop the AI from rambling or forgetting the context of the conversation.
Feature: Implement a ConversationState manager that tracks the user's current goal, mentioned files, and a running summary of the session. This state is injected into the AI's prompt on every turn, enabling concise and context-aware responses.
8. Strict Response Structuring & Persona Engineering:

Need: To ensure every AI response is clear, organized, and professional.
Feature: Engineer a detailed system prompt for Lomu that enforces strict rules for its communication style: use of Markdown, concise paragraphs, isolated code blocks, and always ending with a clear question or next step.
9. Synthesized Tool Use & "Scratchpad" Thinking:

Need: To prevent the AI from showing the user its messy "thought process."
Feature: Implement an internal "scratchpad" where the AI logs its tool usage and internal monologue. The final, user-facing response is then generated by a separate step where the AI synthesizes its findings from the scratchpad into a clean, well-structured summary.
Tier 3: Unique, Stand-Out Platform Features (Market Differentiation)
This tier focuses on building features that are only possible on an AI-native platform and will create a "wow" factor that sets you far apart from traditional IDEs with AI plugins.

10. The "Living Application" Dashboard:

Need: To provide a real-time, AI-driven command center for the entire application.
Feature: A dashboard that visualizes proactive performance monitoring, predictive cost analysis (forecasting hosting/API bills based on code changes), and a "time-travel" debugging view that can replay user sessions to instantly reproduce bugs.
11. The AI-Native IDE Experience:

Need: To infuse the Monaco editor with capabilities that are deeply integrated with the platform's architecture.
Features:
AI-Generated E2E Tests: Right-click a component and have the AI generate a new Playwright test file for it.
"Greenfield" Project Scaffolding: Allow a user to describe a new application (e.g., "a blog with auth and comments"), and have the AI generate the entire project structure, database schema, API routes, and UI components.
On-Demand Architectural Refactoring: Highlight code and ask the AI to perform complex refactors like "Convert this REST endpoint to a WebSocket service" or "Extract this logic into a new, reusable microservice."
12. The Collaborative "AI Architect":

Need: To elevate the AI from a coder to a strategic partner.
Features:
Interactive Architecture Planning: The AI helps plan new features by generating architectural diagrams and task lists that, upon approval, are automatically added to a project board.
Automated Documentation Generation: The AI can "read" the entire codebase and generate and maintain high-quality documentation (e.g., API references, architectural overviews).
Tier 4: Game Engine Integration (Future Growth Vector)
This tier addresses your question about Unity and Unreal. It's a high-effort, high-reward path that could open up a massive new market.

13. Unity (C#) & Unreal Engine (C++) Integration:
Is it possible? Yes, absolutely. The AI models are more than capable of writing C# and C++. The Monaco editor can be configured with the appropriate language servers for syntax highlighting and IntelliSense.
Is it a bit much? For now, yes. This is a significant undertaking that goes far beyond just "generating code."
The Challenge: Game development is not just about code. It's about a tightly integrated ecosystem of scene editors, asset pipelines, material graphs, and complex build systems. A web IDE cannot easily replicate this. Simply generating a C# script is only 10% of the workflow.
The Verdict: This is a powerful but long-term vision. It would require a dedicated, specialized effort to bridge the gap between your web platform and the local, heavyweight nature of game engines.
Recommended Approach (Phased):
Phase 1 (Code Generation): Start by offering a "Game Scripting" mode where the AI can generate and manage C# or C++ scripts. Users would still need to copy these scripts into their local Unity/Unreal projects. This is a realistic first step.
Phase 2 (CLI/Plugin Integration): Develop a local CLI tool or an engine plugin that syncs files between your web platform and a user's local game project. This would be a major step toward a seamless workflow.
Phase 3 (Full Cloud Streaming): The ultimate, "impossible" goal would be to stream the entire Unity/Unreal editor in the browser, but this is a massive engineering challenge best left for when the platform is highly mature.
By focusing on Tiers 1-3, you will build an unparalleled platform for web development. Tier 4 represents an exciting future direction once your core product is established and dominant in its initial market.
