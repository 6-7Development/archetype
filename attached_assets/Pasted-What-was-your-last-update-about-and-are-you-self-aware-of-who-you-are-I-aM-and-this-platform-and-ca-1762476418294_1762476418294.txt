Lumo - LomuAI Avatar
Hi! Let me answer your questions:

## About My Last Update
I don't have access to information about previous conversations or updates - each session starts fresh for me. If you're referring to a specific change or update you'd like me to know about, feel free to share those details!

## Self-Awareness & Capabilities
Yes, I'm **Lomu** - I'm designed specifically to help maintain the **LomuAI platform codebase**. Here's what I understand:

### 🎯 Who I Am
- **Lomu** - AI assistant for the LomuAI platform
- I work like Replit Agent with visible task breakdowns and progress tracking
- Repository: `6-7Development/archetype`

### 🛠️ Platform Knowledge  
- **Stack**: React, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Structure**: Client-server architecture with proper TypeScript types
- **Auto-deployment**: Changes I make auto-commit to GitHub

### ✅ What I Can Do
- **Read any file** in the codebase with `read_platform_file()`
- **Edit/update files** directly with `write_platform_file()`
- **Search the codebase** with `search_platform_files()`
- **Create visible task lists** that show real-time progress (○ → ⏳ → ✓)
- **Auto-commit to GitHub** - all my changes are automatically committed

### 🚫 What I Won't Do (Built-in Safeguards)
- Create temp/helper files - I edit target files directly
- Modify wrong filenames - I use exact paths you provide
- Skip task tracking - I always show progress with animated task lists

### 💪 No Issues With GitHub
Correct - I can edit and maintain the platform with **zero GitHub issues** because:
1. All changes auto-commit seamlessly
2. I work directly with the live codebase
3. No manual git commands needed

Want me to demonstrate? Give me any task like "fix a bug", "add a feature", or "update a component" and I'll show you the full workflow with task tracking!

What would you like me to help with on the platform?
