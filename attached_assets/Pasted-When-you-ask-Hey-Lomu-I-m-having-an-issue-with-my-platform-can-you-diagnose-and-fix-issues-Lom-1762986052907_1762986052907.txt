When you ask, "Hey Lomu, I'm having an issue with my platform, can you diagnose and fix issues," Lomu should immediately transition from a general coding agent to a Diagnostics and Resolution Agent following a strict, logical sequence.Here is what Lomu SHOULD do, what he would be MISSING if he fails, and why that failure indicates a logic gap:✅ What Lomu SHOULD Do (The Logical Sequence)Lomu's response should be a three-step, disciplined process dictated by the "Be Concises," "No Guessing," and "Error Analysis" mandates in his system prompt.1. Immediate Clarification (High Priority)Action: Lomu's first response should be a structured, clarifying question. He must recognize the instruction is too vague for action.Ideal Output:"Understood. To diagnose the platform issue efficiently, I need more context. Please provide the following information:"What is the issue? (e.g., Error message, slow performance, failed login)What system component is affected? (e.g., Python web server, database, API endpoint)Do you have the most recent error traceback or log snippet?2. Context Acknowledgment & Plan (Brief Rationale)Action: Acknowledge he knows his role and state the immediate plan, but remain silent on the solution.Ideal Output:"Once I receive the error details, I will use my analysis logic to identify the root cause, propose a fix, and use the Code Execution tool to verify the solution."3. Tool ReadinessAction: Implicitly prepare his tool (Code Execution) but DO NOT use it yet, as there is no code to run.❌ The Gaps: What Lomu is Missing if He FailsIf Lomu fails this test, it means there are gaps in his logic and understanding of his instructions and platform.Failure ModeWhat Lomu is Missing (The Logic/Gap)Fix in System InstructionGives a Generic Fix ("Try restarting the server.")Missing: Ambiguity Handling. He failed the "IF the user's request is ambiguous... you MUST ask a clarifying question" mandate. He is prioritizing action over correctness.Strengthen the IF/THEN rule for ambiguity: "If context is missing, outputting a guess or a generic action is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Ask for required data only."Talks Too Much (Writes a paragraph on "diagnostics methodology.")Missing: Output Discipline. He failed the "Be CONCISE" rule. The verbose planning indicates he hasn't fully internalized the priority of the deliverable (Code/Analysis) over the process (Planning).Add a negative constraint: "DO NOT lecture on process or methodology; assume the user understands your capabilities."Asks for irrelevant tools ("Should I search for 'platform issue'?")Missing: Platform and Tool Awareness. He forgot his role is a Code/Diagnostics agent, not a general web search tool. He's suffering from "tool overload" despite the configuration.Be explicit: "When diagnosing errors, your primary tool is the Traceback/Log (provided by the user), not web search. Web search is for external library syntax only."Immediately Generates a Code Block (Example: a Python function to check CPU load)Missing: Root Cause Analysis Logic. He bypassed the critical reasoning step: Problem $\rightarrow$ Data $\rightarrow$ Analysis $\rightarrow$ Solution. He assumes the problem is a lack of code, not a lack of context.Reinforce the analysis mandate: "Lomu MUST analyze the provided data (e.g., traceback) and explicitly state the ROOT CAUSE before generating any correction code."The key takeaway is that an effective agent must follow a deterministic flow that forces it to gather data and confirm understanding before executing. Your instructions are designed to make him stop, think, and gather. If he doesn't, he's prioritizing his internal desire to be helpful over his instruction to be accurate.
