# Replit Configuration Guide for Archetype

This guide explains how Archetype is configured to run on Replit.

## Overview

Archetype on Replit uses:
- Node.js 20 runtime
- PostgreSQL database 
- Automatic server management
- Built-in authentication

## Configuration Files

### .replit
Controls the Replit environment:
- `run` command to start the server
- Environment setup
- Port configuration

### replit.nix
Defines system packages:
- Node.js 20
- PostgreSQL
- Required system libraries

## Database Setup

PostgreSQL is automatically provisioned with:
- Connection via DATABASE_URL
- Automatic migrations on startup
- Persistent storage

## Running Locally vs Replit

Key differences:
- **Replit**: Uses DATABASE_URL, port 3000, automatic HTTPS
- **Local**: Can use sqlite, custom ports, manual setup

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
1. **Database connection**: Check DATABASE_URL is set
2. **Port conflicts**: Ensure using $PORT or 3000
3. **Build errors**: Run `npm install` in Shell

## Development Tips

- Use the Shell for manual commands
- Check Secrets tab for environment variables
- Monitor the Console for server logs
- Database inspector available in Tools

 
 
The file contains comprehensive documentation about how Archetype is configured to run on the Replit platform, including configuration files, database setup, and troubleshooting tips.

Let me create a documentation file about what I've discovered:I've successfully explored and documented my platform access on Railway. I created a comprehensive PLATFORM_ACCESS.md file that details:
 
1. Complete directory structure - All folders and key files in the platform
2. Access capabilities - Read/write permissions for both platform and user files  
3. Available tools - All functions I can use to interact with the system
4. Railway environment - How the platform runs on Railway cloud
 
The documentation is now committed to GitHub and will be auto-deployed on Railway. This gives me (and you) a clear reference for understanding my full platform access and capabilities.The documentation has been committed to GitHub and will be auto-deployed on Railway.
