this area should show tasks that meta will do or assign to sub agents but as each one is done there should be a green arrow for each one as they are completed then all green as it does now to show completion... please update this to show what i want animated progress bars or arrows whatever.

I'll enhance the task tracking system to show animated progress indicators that fill in green as each task is completed, making it visually engaging like modern CI/CD pipelines!I'll enhance the task tracking system to show animated progress indicators that fill in green as each task is completed, making it visually engaging like modern CI/CD pipelines!Creating a task list to track my progress...

[WARNING] Error Handling Issue: 8 database calls without try/catch Location: server/routes.ts Evidence: DB operations should be wrapped in error handling

[WARNING] Security Issue: 9 routes but only 0 validations - missing input validation Location: server/routes.ts Evidence: All user inputs should be validated

[CRITICAL] Security Issue: 123 potential SQL injection vulnerabilities (string concatenation) Location: server/storage.ts Evidence: Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation

Recommendations:

Split large files into smaller modules (< 500 lines each)
Extract reusable logic into separate utility files
Add cleanup handlers for WebSockets (ws.on("error") and ws.on("close"))
Implement .delete() or .clear() for Map instances when items are no longer needed
Remove event listeners in cleanup functions
Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
Use batch queries instead of loops with individual queries
Add database indexes for commonly queried fields
Move all secrets to environment variables
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
Add input validation using Zod schemas for all API routes
Implement connection pooling with proper limits
Add timeout handling for long-running operations
PRIORITY: Address critical issues first - they can cause production outages
Run diagnosis tool regularly during development

Here's what I added:Perfect! I've completely enhanced the TaskBoard with beautiful animated progress indicators! Here's what I added:

✨ Enhanced Animation Features:
1. 🎯 Individual Task Progress Bars
Each completed task gets an animated progress bar at the bottom
Smoothly fills from 0% to 100% over 500ms when task completes
Beautiful green gradient (from-green-500 to-emerald-400)
2. 🎨 Animated Status Icons
✅ Completed: Green checkmark with zoom-in animation + sliding arrow
🔵 In Progress: Pulsing play button with ping effect
⭕ Pending: Subtle gray circle
❌ Failed: Red X with emphasis
3. 🌊 Smooth State Transitions
Pending: Gray background
In Progress: Blue glowing border with pulse animation
Completed: Green background with celebration effects
4. 🎉 Completion Celebrations
Green ping dots appear when tasks complete
Sliding arrows animate in from the left
Overall progress bar gets gradient colors and pulse when 100% complete
"Complete!" badge slides in when all tasks done
5. 📊 Enhanced Overall Progress
Gradient progress bar (from-green-500 via-emerald-400 to-green-300)
Smooth 1-second animations for progress changes
Pulse effect when fully complete
"Complete!" indicator with checkmark
6. 💫 Visual Polish
Sequential animations: Tasks animate one by one as they complete
Smooth transitions: All state changes have 300-500ms animations
Celebration effects: Small ping dots and sliding elements
Color-coded states: Each status has distinct colors and effects
🎬 How It Works:
Task starts: Gray circle, muted text
Task in progress: Blue pulsing play icon, highlighted background
Task completes:
Progress bar animates 0→100%
Green checkmark zooms in
Arrow slides in from left
Celebration ping effect
Background turns green
Now when Meta-SySop or sub-agents work on tasks, users will see beautiful animated progress indicators that fill in green with smooth arrows and celebration effects as each task completes! 🚀## ✨ Enhanced Animation Features:
