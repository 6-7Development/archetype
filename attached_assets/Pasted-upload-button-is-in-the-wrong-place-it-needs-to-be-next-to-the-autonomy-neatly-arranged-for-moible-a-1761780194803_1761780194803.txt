upload button is in the wrong place it needs to be next to the autonomy neatly arranged for moible and desktop easy of use

✅ Diagnosis Complete

Analyzed 4 files, found 11 issues (5 critical, 6 warnings)

Findings:

[WARNING] Code Organization Issue: File is 2405 lines - consider refactoring Location: server/storage.ts Evidence: File has 2405 lines

[CRITICAL] Database N+1 Issue: Found 1 potential N+1 query patterns (DB calls inside loops) Location: server/storage.ts Evidence: Detected await storage/db calls inside loops

[CRITICAL] Memory Leak Issue: WebSocket connections without error handler - can leak memory Location: server/routes.ts Evidence: No ws.on("error") handler found

[WARNING] Connection Management Issue: WebSocket without close handler - connections may not be cleaned up Location: server/routes.ts Evidence: No ws.on("close") handler found

[CRITICAL] Memory Leak Issue: WebSocket connections without error handler - can leak memory Location: server/anthropic.ts Evidence: No ws.on("error") handler found

[WARNING] Connection Management Issue: WebSocket without close handler - connections may not be cleaned up Location: server/anthropic.ts Evidence: No ws.on("close") handler found

[CRITICAL] Memory Leak Issue: WebSocket connections without error handler - can leak memory Location: server/index.ts Evidence: No ws.on("error") handler found

[WARNING] Connection Management Issue: WebSocket without close handler - connections may not be cleaned up Location: server/index.ts Evidence: No ws.on("close") handler found

[WARNING] Error Handling Issue: 8 database calls without try/catch Location: server/routes.ts Evidence: DB operations should be wrapped in error handling

[WARNING] Security Issue: 9 routes but only 0 validations - missing input validation Location: server/routes.ts Evidence: All user inputs should be validated

[CRITICAL] Security Issue: 123 potential SQL injection vulnerabilities (string concatenation) Location: server/storage.ts Evidence: Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation

Recommendations:

Split large files into smaller modules (< 500 lines each)
Extract reusable logic into separate utility files
Add cleanup handlers for WebSockets (ws.on("error") and ws.on("close"))
Implement .delete() or .clear() for Map instances when items are no longer needed
Remove event listeners in cleanup functions
Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
Use batch queries instead of loops with individual queries
Add database indexes for commonly queried fields
Move all secrets to environment variables
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
Add input validation using Zod schemas for all API routes
Implement connection pooling with proper limits
Add timeout handling for long-running operations
PRIORITY: Address critical issues first - they can cause production outages
Run diagnosis tool regularly during development
