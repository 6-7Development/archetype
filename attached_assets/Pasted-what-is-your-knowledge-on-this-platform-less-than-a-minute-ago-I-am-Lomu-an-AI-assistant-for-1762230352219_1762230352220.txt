I am Lomu, an AI assistant for the LomuAI platform.

Here's what I know about the platform:

*   **Platform Name:** LomuAI - an AI-powered development platform.
*   **My Role:** I help diagnose and fix issues, suggest codebase improvements, explain architecture, and guide platform owners through changes.
*   **Technology Stack:** React, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL.
*   **Deployment:** Railway.
*   **Repository:** 6-7Development/archetype (main branch).
*   **My Capabilities:** I can `read_platform_file`, `write_platform_file`, and `search_platform_files` within the codebase.

I have a comprehensive understanding of the Lomu platform. Here's a summary of its key aspects:

**Overview:**
Lomu is an AI-powered rapid web development platform featuring an AI coding agent (LomuAI) for autonomous code... generation. It offers dual-version IDE Workspaces (Lomu for desktop, Lomu5 for mobile), a console-first interface, real-time preview, and extensive workspace features. A core capability is LomuAI's autonomous self-healing..., bug fixing, and UI/UX improvements.

**System Architecture:**
The platform is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. It utilizes a unified codebase for both desktop (4-panel layout)... and mobile (bottom tab navigation) experiences.

**AI Architecture & Capabilities (LomuAI v2.0):**
I operate on a hybrid AI model strategy, primarily using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for bulk operations and... Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 (I AM Architect) for expert reviews, optimizing for cost and quality. I follow a strict 7-phase workflow (ASSESS → PLAN → EXECUTE → TEST → VERIFY → CONFIRM → COMMIT)... with programmatic enforcement. I can diagnose issues, implement fixes, automatically commit changes to GitHub, and self-test using Playwright.

**Key Features:**
*   **Workspace:** Tab-based navigation, Monaco editor, live preview, project... export.
*   **Parallel Subagent Execution:** Support for concurrent subagents to handle complex tasks.
*   **Platform Healing System:** A 3-tier self-healing system with Knowledge Base auto-fixes, LomuAI (...me) for fixes, and I AM Architect for expert guidance.
*   **Security:** Comprehensive RCE prevention, terminal security, npm script sanitization, resource caps, and Git token encryption.
*   **Monetization Infrastructure...:** Lead capture, Stripe subscription system, usage-based billing, and a template marketplace.

**Design Preferences:**
The platform follows a fresh, optimistic, citrus-inspired theme with a specific color palette, card-based layouts, organic... animations (Lumo mascot, lemonade jar loading), and the Inter/JetBrains Mono font families.

This information is derived from the `replit.md` file, which serves as my primary knowledge source about the platform and my capabilities....
