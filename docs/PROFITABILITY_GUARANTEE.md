## 📊 Worst-Case Scenario Analysis

### **Scenario: Customer Uses 100% of Credits on AI (Most Expensive)**

Let's analyze what happens if a customer maxes out their entire credit allocation on AI tokens:

---

### **Starter Plan: $49/month**
**Credits Included:** 980 credits = 980,000 tokens

**Worst Case (All Output Tokens - Most Expensive):**
- Customer uses all 980K tokens on output (most expensive)
- Provider cost: 980K × $0.015/1K = **$14.70**
- Infrastructure: **$8.50/month**
- Storage: **$1.00/month**
- **Total Cost: $24.20**

**Revenue: $49**  
**Profit: $24.80**  
**Margin: 51% ✅ PROFITABLE**

---

### **Pro Plan: $129/month**
**Credits Included:** 2,580 credits = 2,580,000 tokens

**Worst Case (All Output Tokens):**
- Provider cost: 2.58M × $0.015/1K = **$38.70**
- Infrastructure: **$8.50/month**
- Storage: **$4.00/month**
- **Total Cost: $51.20**

**Revenue: $129**  
**Profit: $77.80**  
**Margin: 60% ✅ PROFITABLE**

---

### **Business Plan: $299/month**
**Credits Included:** 5,980 credits = 5,980,000 tokens

**Worst Case (All Output Tokens):**
- Provider cost: 5.98M × $0.015/1K = **$89.70**
- Infrastructure: **$42.50/month** (5 users)
- Storage: **$20.00/month**
- **Total Cost: $152.20**

**Revenue: $299**  
**Profit: $146.80**  
**Margin: 49% ✅ PROFITABLE**

---

### **Enterprise Plan: $899/month**
**Credits Included:** 17,980 credits = 17,980,000 tokens

**Worst Case (All Output Tokens):**
- Provider cost: 17.98M × $0.015/1K = **$269.70**
- Infrastructure: **$8.50/month**
- Storage: **$100.00/month**
- **Total Cost: $378.20**

**Revenue: $899**  
**Profit: $520.80**  
**Margin: 58% ✅ PROFITABLE**

## 🎯 Realistic Usage (More Profitable!)

In reality, customers don't use 100% output tokens. Here's realistic usage:

**Typical LomuAI Project:**
- 55K input tokens × $0.003/1K = $0.165
- 28K output tokens × $0.015/1K = $0.420
- **Total: $0.585 per project**

**Profit Per Project:**
- Customer pays: ~$1.50 (in credits)
- Your cost: $0.585
- **Profit: $0.915 per project** (61% margin)

## 💸 Overage Pricing - Pure Profit

When customers exceed their plan limits, overage kicks in:

| **Plan** | **Overage Rate** | **Provider Cost** | **Profit/1K Tokens** | **Margin** |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Starter** | $0.06/1K | $0.012/1K | $0.048/1K | **80%** |
| **Pro** | $0.05/1K | $0.012/1K | $0.038/1K | **76%** |
| **Business** | $0.04/1K | $0.012/1K | $0.028/1K | **70%** |
| **Enterprise** | $0.03/1K | $0.012/1K | $0.018/1K | **60%** |

**Overage is EVEN MORE profitable** than base plans!
