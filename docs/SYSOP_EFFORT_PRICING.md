# SySop AI - Effort-Based Pricing Model
## Transparent Checkpoint Billing

### Overview
SySop AI uses an **effort-based pricing model** where you pay based on the complexity and scope of your request, not a fixed rate. Smaller requests cost less, complex builds cost more.

---

#### 🟣 **EXTENDED THINKING** ($1.00/checkpoint) - 1.25x multiplier
**Examples:**
- Complex architecture analysis

- Performance optimization
- Security audit & implementation
- Migration/refactoring large codebases
- Advanced state management

**Characteristics:**
- Requires deep architectural planning
- Multiple solution paths considered
- Optimization analysis required

- Enterprise-grade requirements

---

#### 🔴 **HIGH POWER** ($1.60/checkpoint) - 2x multiplier
**Examples:**
- Enterprise SaaS platforms
- Complex marketplace systems (multi-vendor with payments)
- Advanced game engines with physics
- ML/AI integration projects
- Microservices architecture
- Real-time collaboration systems
- Advanced WebGL/3D rendering

**Characteristics:**
- 20+ files
- 5,000+ lines of code
- 30+ minute completion time
- Multiple advanced technologies
- Scalability/performance critical
- Enterprise security required

---

### Complexity Detection (Automatic)

SySop automatically detects complexity based on:

1. **Request Analysis:**
   - Keywords: "simple", "quick", "basic" → SIMPLE
   - Keywords: "full", "complete", "production" → COMPLEX
   - Keywords: "enterprise", "scalable", "advanced" → HIGH POWER

2. **Technology Stack:**
   - Static HTML/CSS → SIMPLE
   - React + basic API → STANDARD
   - Full-stack + database + auth → COMPLEX
   - Microservices + scaling → HIGH POWER

3. **Feature Count:**
   - 1-3 features → SIMPLE
   - 4-8 features → STANDARD
   - 9-15 features → COMPLEX
   - 16+ features → HIGH POWER

4. **File Estimation:**
   - 1-2 files → SIMPLE
   - 3-8 files → STANDARD
   - 9-20 files → COMPLEX
   - 20+ files → HIGH POWER

---

### Checkpoint System

**What is a Checkpoint?**
A checkpoint represents ONE completed request with all associated work bundled together:
- Initial analysis
- Code generation
- Testing & validation
- Bug fixes (if needed)
- Final delivery

**You Only Pay for Successful Checkpoints:**
- ✅ Initial planning & proposals are FREE
- ✅ Failed attempts are FREE (we retry until success)
- ✅ One checkpoint = one complete, working solution
- ❌ Partial work is not billed

---

### Usage Display (Replit-Style)

After each checkpoint, users see:
```
✅ Checkpoint completed just now

"Create a modern todo app with React and local storage"

Time worked:     12 minutes
Work done:       1 checkpoint
Agent Usage:     $0.40

Actions:
• Generated 6 files (index.html, App.jsx, TodoList.jsx, style.css, utils.js, README.md)
• Implemented React with hooks
• Added localStorage persistence
• Tested CRUD operations
• Validated accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
```

---

### Value Proposition

**SySop AI delivers superior value through:**
- ✅ SySop with Architect consultation for deadlock resolution
- ✅ 12-step quality workflow with self-testing
- ✅ Fortune 500-grade security built-in
- ✅ Instant deployment included
- ✅ Higher success rate (fewer retries)

---

### Integration with Plan Limits

**FREE Plan:**
- 3 checkpoints total (any complexity)
- ~$0.40 avg = $1.20 value

**STARTER Plan ($49/mo):**
- 30 AI projects = 30 checkpoints
- ~$0.40 avg = $12 cost → **$37 profit (76% margin)**

**PRO Plan ($149/mo):**
- 100 AI projects = 100 checkpoints
- ~$0.40 avg = $40 cost → **$109 profit (73% margin)**

**ENTERPRISE Plan ($999/mo base):**
- 1,000 checkpoints fair use
- ~$0.40 avg = $400 cost
- Infrastructure: $268.50
- **Total cost: $668.50 → $330.50 profit (33% margin) on base**
- **Overages at 90% margin preserve overall profitability**

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Complexity Detection in SySop Prompt:**
   - Analyze request before generation
   - Return complexity tier with response
   - Include estimated file count & time

2. **Checkpoint Billing:**
   - Track start/end time per request
   - Calculate actual complexity cost
   - Store in `usage_logs` table with type: 'checkpoint'

3. **Usage Display:**
   - Show "Time worked", "Work done", "Agent Usage"
   - List all actions taken
   - Display quality validations passed

4. **Cost Enforcement:**
   - Deduct AI credits per checkpoint
   - Check limits before starting work
   - Show upgrade prompt when limits reached
