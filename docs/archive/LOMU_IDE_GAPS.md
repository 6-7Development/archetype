# LomuAI IDE Gaps vs Replit - CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES

## Layout & Navigation Gaps
- ❌ **No Tab Navigation**: Missing Editor, Preview, Files, Git, Database, Terminal, Env, Logs tabs
- ❌ **No Workspace Selector**: Can't switch between projects/workspaces from chat
- ❌ **No File Browser**: No left sidebar showing project structure
- ❌ **No Terminal Panel**: Terminal output not integrated into chat view
- ❌ **No Preview Pane**: No live preview of built apps inline

## Workflow Integration Gaps
- ❌ **No Build Status**: Can't see if project is building/deployed
- ❌ **No Deploy Button**: No "Publish" button in header
- ❌ **No Workflow Status**: No visual indication of active tasks/jobs
- ❌ **No Task Progress**: Can't see LomuAI's execution progress in IDE
- ❌ **No Console Output**: Build/CLI output not shown in chat

## Chat-IDE Linkage Gaps
- ❌ **No File Links**: Chat can't reference/link to specific files
- ❌ **No Goto Actions**: Can't jump from chat to file:line in editor
- ❌ **No Inline Diffs**: Can't see code changes without switching context
- ❌ **No Error Clickthrough**: Errors in chat don't link to source
- ❌ **No Quick Actions**: No "Apply", "Reject", "Modify" buttons for code blocks

## Data Display Gaps
- ❌ **No Git Status**: Can't see branch, commits, changes from chat
- ❌ **No Env Variables**: No way to view/manage env vars inline
- ❌ **No Database Schema**: Can't browse database structure
- ❌ **No Analytics**: No usage/billing/performance stats

## Replit Feature Parity
Missing from LomuAI that Replit has:
1. **Multi-file Code Display** - Only shows text, not formatted code blocks
2. **Real-time Sync** - Changes in editor don't update chat state
3. **Collaborative Awareness** - No user presence/activity indicators
4. **Project Templates** - Can't create from starter templates
5. **Deployment Dashboard** - No build history/logs viewer
6. **Performance Monitoring** - No CPU/memory/network stats

## Priority Fixes (Phase 2)
1. Add tab navigation bar (Editor, Preview, Files, Terminal)
2. Add workspace/project selector dropdown
3. Add terminal output panel to chat
4. Add file browser sidebar
5. Add build status indicator
6. Add deploy button in header
