# Lomu - "When Code Throws You Lemons"

## Overview
Lomu is an AI-powered platform designed for rapid web development, featuring LomuAI, an autonomous AI coding agent, and dual-version IDE Workspaces (Lomu for desktop, Lomu5 for mobile). It offers a console-first interface, real-time preview, and comprehensive workspace features. The platform aims for production readiness with portable deployment, monetization infrastructure, a template marketplace, and professional development services. A key capability is LomuAI's autonomous self-healing, bug fixing, and UI/UX improvements to its own source code, complete with rollback and audit logging.

## User Preferences
### API Configuration
**Claude Sonnet 4 Unified Strategy**:
- **ALL AI Operations Use Claude Sonnet 4** via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  - Cost: $3.00 input / $15.00 output per 1M tokens
  - 200K token context window
  - Used for: LomuAI Chat (37 tools), Platform Healing (3 tools), I AM Architect
  
**Why Claude-Only?**
- ✅ Reliable tool execution (no hallucinated Python syntax like Gemini)
- ✅ Better token control (prevents token waste)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all AI operations
- ✅ Costs more but provides full internal control
- ⚠️ Gemini temporarily disabled until tool reliability issues are resolved

### Design Preferences
- **Brand Identity**: Fresh, optimistic, citrus-inspired theme
- **Color Palette**:
  - Sparkling Lemon (50 98% 58%) - Primary vibrant yellow
  - Fresh Mint (145 60% 45%) - Success green
  - Citrus Bloom (32 94% 62%) - Warning orange
  - Slate Professional (210 14% 24%) - Text and contrast
  - Cream Base (48 46% 96%) - Soft backgrounds
- **Visual Language**:
  - Bright, welcoming interfaces with playful professionalism
  - Card-based layouts with warm shadows
  - Clean, approachable design with generous spacing
  - Inter font family for UI text, JetBrains Mono for code
  - Light mode primary with dark mode support
  - Organic animations (Lumo breathing, lemonade filling)
- **Illustration Elements**:
  - Lemonade jar loading animations (SVG with animated fill and bubbles)
  - Lumo mascot with natural sprite animations
  - Subtle lemon motifs and citrus accents
  - Ice cubes, bubbles, and fresh visual flourishes

## System Architecture
The platform is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

### Dual-Version Architecture
The platform utilizes a unified codebase to support two distinct user experiences: Lomu (Desktop) with a 4-panel layout, and Lomu5 (Mobile) with bottom tab navigation. Both versions share backend APIs, WebSocket connections, authentication, and database access.

### UI/UX Decisions
The user interface features a tab-based workspace providing an IDE-like experience, primarily through a command console and real-time live preview. The design emphasizes a fresh, optimistic aesthetic with a citrus-inspired color palette, card-based layouts, warm shadows, smooth transitions, and ADA/WCAG accessibility. Chat interfaces feature Lumo the Lemon mascot as an AI companion with natural sprite animations and emotional expressions. Loading states use a signature lemonade jar animation.

### Parallel Subagent Execution
LomuAI supports parallel subagent orchestration, allowing multiple tasks to execute simultaneously with Railway-safe resource limits. Tasks are queued, and progress is broadcast via WebSockets.

### Technical Implementations
- **AI Architecture**: LomuAI v2.0 follows a strict 7-phase workflow (ASSESS → PLAN → EXECUTE → TEST → VERIFY → CONFIRM → COMMIT) with programmatic enforcement. It includes real-time streaming, usage-based billing, self-testing (Playwright), web search (Tavily API), vision analysis (Claude Vision), architectural guidance (I AM Architect), and an automatic reflection/self-correction loop.
- **Autonomous AI System (LomuAI v2.0)**: LomuAI diagnoses issues, implements fixes, and automatically commits changes to GitHub, triggering auto-deployment.
- **Developer Tools**: LomuAI includes 56 tools covering core operations, deployment, secrets management, database, design, integrations, and file operations, all with security sandboxing and WebSocket event streaming.
- **Platform Healing System**: A self-healing infrastructure with 3-tier intelligent routing for incident resolution (Knowledge Base, LomuAI v2.0, I AM Architect). Automatic quality monitoring triggers I AM Architect for diagnosis and fixes when quality is low.
- **LomuAI v2.0 Workflow Enforcement**: Dual-layer enforcement via enhanced system prompts and a WorkflowValidator State Machine.
- **Real-Time Enforcement System**: A 6-layer system integrated into `lomuJobManager` validates LomuAI responses and triggers I AM Architect guidance.
- **Real-Time LomuAI + I AM Teamwork**: I AM Architect intervenes during active LomuAI sessions when workflow rules are violated, with a "3-Strikes Escalation" policy.
- **Critical Files Protection System**: Read-before-write enforcement for 8 core infrastructure files to prevent accidental overwrites.
- **Replit Agent Parity**: LomuAI matches Replit Agent's complex task handling with extended iteration limits and intelligent token/context management, including auto-commits.
- **Command System**: Natural language commands processed by Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate JSON project structures.
- **File Management**: Generated files are stored in PostgreSQL, editable via Monaco editor, with real-time WebSocket synchronization.
- **Preview System**: Uses `esbuild` for in-memory React/TypeScript compilation for live application previews.
- **Multi-Agent Task Management System**: Foundation for autonomous task breakdown with database tables and LomuAI tools, supporting sub-agents, message queues, autonomy controls, and dynamic intelligence.
