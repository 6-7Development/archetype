# Lomu - "When Code Throws You Lemons"

## Overview
Lomu is an AI-powered platform for rapid web development, featuring LomuAI, an autonomous AI coding agent, and dual-version IDE Workspaces (Lomu for desktop, Lomu5 for mobile). It offers a console-first interface, real-time preview, and comprehensive workspace features. The platform aims for production readiness with portable deployment, monetization infrastructure, a template marketplace, and professional development services. A key capability is LomuAI's autonomous self-healing, bug fixing, and UI/UX improvements to its own source code, complete with rollback and audit logging.

## User Preferences
### API Configuration
**Claude Sonnet 4 Unified Strategy**:
- **ALL AI Operations Use Claude Sonnet 4** via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  - Cost: $3.00 input / $15.00 output per 1M tokens
  - 200K token context window
  - Used for: LomuAI Chat (37 tools), Platform Healing (3 tools), I AM Architect
  
**Why Claude-Only?**
- ✅ Reliable tool execution (no hallucinated Python syntax like Gemini)
- ✅ Better token control (prevents token waste)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all AI operations
- ✅ Costs more but provides full internal control
- ⚠️ Gemini temporarily disabled until tool reliability issues are resolved

### Design Preferences
- **Brand Identity**: Fresh, optimistic, citrus-inspired theme
- **Color Palette**:
  - Sparkling Lemon (50 98% 58%) - Primary vibrant yellow
  - Fresh Mint (145 60% 45%) - Success green
  - Citrus Bloom (32 94% 62%) - Warning orange
  - Slate Professional (210 14% 24%) - Text and contrast
  - Cream Base (48 46% 96%) - Soft backgrounds
- **Visual Language**:
  - Bright, welcoming interfaces with playful professionalism
  - Card-based layouts with warm shadows
  - Clean, approachable design with generous spacing
  - Inter font family for UI text, JetBrains Mono for code
  - Light mode primary with dark mode support
  - Organic animations (Lumo breathing, lemonade filling)
- **Illustration Elements**:
  - Lemonade jar loading animations (SVG with animated fill and bubbles)
  - Lumo mascot with natural sprite animations
  - Subtle lemon motifs and citrus accents
  - Ice cubes, bubbles, and fresh visual flourishes

## System Architecture
The platform is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

### Dual-Version Architecture
The platform utilizes a unified codebase to support two distinct user experiences: Lomu (Desktop) with a 4-panel layout, and Lomu5 (Mobile) with bottom tab navigation. Both versions share backend APIs, WebSocket connections, authentication, and database access.

### UI/UX Decisions
The user interface features a tab-based workspace providing an IDE-like experience, primarily through a command console and real-time live preview. The design emphasizes a fresh, optimistic aesthetic with a citrus-inspired color palette, card-based layouts, warm shadows, smooth transitions, and ADA/WCAG accessibility. Chat interfaces feature Lumo the Lemon mascot as an AI companion with natural sprite animations and emotional expressions. Loading states use a signature lemonade jar animation.

### System Design Choices
LomuAI is the sole autonomous worker that commits changes, operating independently with a strict 7-phase workflow (ASSESS → PLAN → EXECUTE → TEST → VERIFY → CONFIRM → COMMIT). I AM Architect is a user-summoned consultant only (premium feature), providing guidance without committing code. The system supports parallel subagent execution, real-time streaming, usage-based billing, and self-testing.

Key features include:
- **GitHub Integration**: Full version control with 6 tools, supporting branching, pull requests, and project export, triggering auto-deployment.
- **Environment Variables Management**: Project-level secrets with 4 tools, database storage, validation, and security masking.
- **Code Intelligence System**: AST-based code understanding via CodeIndexer, FileRelevanceDetector, and SmartChunker for efficient code retrieval and dependency graphing.
- **Platform Healing System**: Two-tier incident resolution (Knowledge Base → LomuAI v2.0).
- **Replit Agent Parity**: Matches Replit Agent's complex task handling with increased token limits, iterations, self-correction, and concurrency.
- **Credit-Based Billing System**: Production-ready monetization with usage-based credits, atomic operations, pause/resume flow, and Stripe integration.
- **Monetization Infrastructure**: Lead capture, Stripe subscription system, webhooks, granular usage billing, and template marketplace commission model.
- **Security & Production Readiness**: Authentication/authorization (Replit Auth, PostgreSQL sessions), protected API routes, rate limiting, bcrypt-hashed API keys, and comprehensive RCE prevention including terminal security and resource caps.

### Feature Specifications
- **Workspace Features**: Tab-based navigation, unified talk & build interface, Monaco editor, full project ZIP export.
- **Publishing/Deployment System**: Management of deployments, logs, and analytics.
- **Team Workspaces**: Collaboration with role-based access and invitations.
- **API Key Management**: Secure system for Pro+ users with hashing, usage tracking, and validation.
