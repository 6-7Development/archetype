# Archetype - AI-Powered Website Builder Platform

## Overview
Archetype is an AI-powered platform for rapid web development, featuring an AI coding agent (SySop) for autonomous code generation and an IDE Workspace. It offers a console-first interface, real-time preview, and a tab-based workspace. The platform includes comprehensive monetization infrastructure with subscription tiers, usage-based billing, a template marketplace, and professional development services. A subsidiary of Drill Consulting 360 LLC, Archetype targets Fortune 500 production readiness and fully portable deployment to any cloud platform. It also features Meta-SySop for autonomous platform self-healing, bug fixes, and UI/UX improvements to its own source code on Render production, with built-in rollback and audit logging.

## System Architecture
The platform is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

### UI/UX Decisions
The user interface features a tab-based workspace (Overview, Build, Files, Preview, Activity, Versions) providing an IDE-like experience. Interaction is primarily through a command console, complemented by a real-time live preview. The design adopts a professional, corporate aesthetic with a navy/slate color palette, card-based layouts, and smooth transitions, ensuring responsiveness and ADA/WCAG accessibility with `prefers-reduced-motion` support. The chat interface is redesigned with a clean, minimal aesthetic, including enhanced progress displays with individual animated progress bars and completion summaries. Mobile responsiveness for the file explorer is implemented with a Sheet overlay for smaller viewports.

### Technical Implementations
- **AI Architecture**: SySop (AI Coding Agent) uses a 12-step workflow with built-in Architect consultation. It includes real-time AI streaming with abort capability and comprehensive billing for AI usage. The SySop system prompt is optimized for quality and expertise in full-stack web, professional games, self-testing, and Orb usage-based billing. SySop uses teaching emojis (ðŸ§ ðŸ”¨âœ…), an "explain like I'm 5" approach, step-by-step updates, and transparent issue reporting.
- **Replit Agent-Style Task Management**: SySop now displays live, interactive task lists (1-12 tasks) with real-time status updates, matching Replit Agent's UX exactly. Tasks show checkmarks (âœ“) for completed, spinning circles (âŠ™) for in-progress, and empty circles (â—‹) for pending states. TaskBoard UI component displays tasks prominently above chat with progress tracking, sub-agent indicators, and WebSocket-driven live updates. Server-side robust JSON parser extracts task plans from Claude responses using balanced-brace matching and fenced code block detection.
- **Autonomous AI System**: SySop is equipped with self-testing (Playwright), web search (Tavily API), vision analysis (Claude Vision), and architectural guidance via I AM (The Architect). It features an automatic reflection loop, a server-side self-correction protocol, and autonomous troubleshooting. Human intervention points are defined for API keys, ambiguous requirements, and after failed fix attempts.
- **Meta-SySop Enhanced Tools**: Meta-SySop now has access to architect_consult (I AM code reviews), web_search (documentation lookup), in addition to platform file operations. This prevents broken commits by requiring architectural approval before platform modifications.
- **Platform Modification Guardrails**: Platform file modifications are disabled in production (Render) due to ephemeral containers. For platform self-healing, Meta-SySop can commit changes to GitHub, triggering auto-deployment, enabled by owner-controlled maintenance mode and specific environment variables.
- **Secrets Management**: Zero-knowledge credential handling for API keys.
- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: SySop can build complex marketplace platforms, professional-grade 2D/3D games, implement Orb usage-based billing, self-test, search documentation, and analyze visuals.
- **Test Data Generation & User Simulation**: SySop can generate realistic test data using faker.js (realistic names, emails, dates) and simulate user behavior with Playwright scripts. It creates seed data for databases, simulates user flows (signup â†’ login â†’ purchase), generates analytics events with proper timestamps, and tests tracking systems with realistic interaction patterns. Supports E2E testing with multiple concurrent simulated users.
- **Bot & Agent Generation**: SySop can create functional chatbots and automation agents for user projects including: AI-powered chatbots for web applications (OpenAI, Anthropic), platform-specific bots (Discord.js, Slack Bolt, Telegram), automation agents (cron jobs, webhooks, data scraping), and background workers. Emphasizes API key security, rate limiting, error handling, and production best practices.
- **Command System**: Natural language commands are processed by Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate project structures as JSON.
- **File Management**: Generated files are stored in PostgreSQL, viewable and editable via a file browser and Monaco editor. Files auto-refresh every 5 seconds with WebSocket push updates for real-time synchronization. Comprehensive console logging tracks file selection, content loading, and editor updates for debugging.
- **Conversational AI**: An AI assistant powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet clarifies questions and explains design decisions, with automatic conversation summarization.
- **Preview System**: Uses `esbuild` for in-memory React/TypeScript compilation to show compiled applications in an iframe, with real-time status and auto-refresh. Preview endpoint includes comprehensive logging for compilation time tracking, entry point detection, and error diagnosis. Supports both public preview sharing and authenticated project viewing.
- **Monolithic Routes Refactoring**: The server routes were modularized to improve performance, reducing `routes.ts` significantly and creating dedicated modules for auth, projects, files, chat, subscriptions, admin, and websocket. Common middleware and utilities were extracted.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Implemented LRU caching, system prompt caching, Gzip compression, WebSocket memory leak fixes (heartbeat, cleanup), and response caching middleware for hot endpoints.
- **Robust JSON Parsing Pipeline**: Developed a 3-tier extraction method for AI responses to handle complex JSON structures, including emojis and braces in strings.
- **Multi-Agent Task Management System**: Foundation for autonomous task breakdown with new database tables and six SySop tools for task list creation, updates, sub-agent delegation, and architect reviews, all with robust security and ownership verification.
- **SySop Diagnostic Tool**: Enhanced `perform_diagnosis` capability with security-first implementation, path validation, and evidence-based analysis for performance, memory, database, and security diagnostics.
