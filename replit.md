# Archetype - AI-Powered Website Builder Platform

## Overview
Archetype is an AI-powered platform for rapid web development, featuring an AI coding agent (SySop) for autonomous code generation and an IDE Workspace. It offers a console-first interface, real-time preview, and a tab-based workspace. The platform includes comprehensive monetization infrastructure with subscription tiers, usage-based billing, a template marketplace, and professional development services. A subsidiary of Drill Consulting 360 LLC, Archetype targets Fortune 500 production readiness and fully portable deployment to any cloud platform. It also features Meta-SySop for autonomous platform self-healing, bug fixes, and UI/UX improvements to its own source code on Render production, with built-in rollback and audit logging.

  - **System Prompt Caching**: Moved 4,602-char base prompt to module level, saving ~4KB per AI request
  - **Response Compression**: Gzip middleware reduces response sizes by 70-80%
  - **WebSocket Memory Leak Fix**: Added error handlers, ping/pong heartbeat (30s), and periodic cleanup of dead connections
  - **Response Caching Middleware**: 5-second cache on hot endpoints (/api/auth/user) with proper cache invalidation
  - All optimizations architect-reviewed and production-ready

### Production Bug Fixes (October 2025)
- **Chat Progress Indicators**: Implemented real-time WebSocket broadcasting to show what SySop is doing during chat conversations
  - Progress messages display tool execution ("Reading file...", "Updating file...", "Modified 3 files")
  - Clear error handling and progress cleanup on completion/failure
  - Tested with Playwright - all tests passing
- **Platform Modification Guardrails**: Added production safety checks for Meta-SySop platform healing
  - **CRITICAL**: Platform file modifications are DISABLED in production (Render)
  - Render uses ephemeral containers - file changes are lost on restart
  - Clear error messages guide users to use local development for platform modifications
  - Reading platform files still works in production for diagnostics
- **Image Upload Directory Creation**: Fixed ENOENT errors by ensuring `attached_assets/chat_images/` directory exists with recursive mkdir before writing files
- **Robust JSON Parsing Pipeline**: Implemented string-aware brace tracking to handle SySop responses with emoji prefixes (ðŸ§ ðŸ”¨âœ…), literal braces in strings, and stray closing braces in preamble
  - 3-tier extraction: Code fences â†’ String-aware brace tracking â†’ Fallback regex
  - Edge cases handled: Escaped quotes, negative depth guard, largest object selection
  - All edge cases tested and architect-approved
- **Max Tokens Optimization**: Clarified Claude Sonnet 4 already at API maximum (8192 output tokens) for optimal response generation

### Multi-Agent Task Management System (October 23, 2025)
- **Replit Agent-Style Capabilities**: Built foundation for autonomous task breakdown, sub-agent delegation, and architect reviews
  - **Database Schema**: New tables for task_lists, tasks, sub_agents, architect_reviews
  - **Six New SySop Tools**: 
    - `create_task_list` - Break down complex requests into structured tasks
    - `update_task` - Track progress and mark tasks complete
    - `read_task_list` - Query task status and details
    - `spawn_sub_agent` - Delegate specialized work to sub-agents
    - `check_sub_agent_status` - Monitor sub-agent progress
    - `request_architect_review` - Get proactive improvement suggestions
  - **Production-Grade Security**: 4 rounds of architect review iterations
    - Cross-tenant isolation with joined ownership queries
    - Project/task/taskList ownership verification on all operations
    - Schema validation with Drizzle Zod
    - Enum validation for status/agentType fields
    - Transactional safety with graceful error handling
  - **Remaining Integration**: API endpoints, frontend components, WebSocket broadcasting, system prompt updates, and end-to-end testing

### Mobile & Diagnostics Enhancements (October 23, 2025)
- **Mobile-Responsive File Explorer**: Implemented Sheet overlay for mobile devices
  - File explorer hidden by default on mobile (<768px viewport)
  - Hamburger menu button in workspace header toggles overlay
  - Auto-closes on file selection for seamless mobile UX
  - Desktop view unchanged (sidebar always visible)
- **Enhanced SySop Diagnostic Tool**: Added comprehensive `perform_diagnosis` capability
  - **Security-first implementation**: Multiple architect review cycles to eliminate command injection vulnerabilities
  - **Path validation**: Rejects absolute paths, shell metacharacters, protects sensitive files (.env, .git, database/)
  - **Evidence-based analysis**: Reads actual file content, counts lines, detects patterns
  - **Diagnostic targets**: Performance (sync ops, large files), Memory (leak detection), Database (N+1 queries), Security (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection)
  - **Safe Node.js APIs**: Uses fs.readFile, fs.stat instead of shell commands
  - **Workspace boundary enforcement**: Proper directory separation checks prevent path traversal

## System Architecture
The platform is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

### UI/UX Decisions
The user interface features a tab-based workspace (Overview, Build, Files, Preview, Activity, Versions) providing an IDE-like experience. Interaction is primarily through a command console, complemented by a real-time live preview. The design adopts a professional, corporate aesthetic with a navy/slate color palette, card-based layouts, and smooth transitions, ensuring responsiveness and ADA/WCAG accessibility with `prefers-reduced-motion` support. The chat interface is redesigned with a clean, minimal aesthetic, including enhanced progress displays with individual animated progress bars and completion summaries.

### Technical Implementations
- **AI Architecture**: SySop (AI Coding Agent) uses a 12-step workflow with built-in Architect consultation for architectural validation. It includes real-time AI streaming with abort capability and comprehensive billing for AI usage.
- **Enhanced SySop System Prompt**: Optimized for high quality through a 14-step workflow, improved JSON formatting, and expertise in full-stack web, professional games, self-testing, and Orb usage-based billing.
- **Professional Communication**: SySop uses teaching emojis (ðŸ§ ðŸ”¨âœ…), an "explain like I'm 5" approach, step-by-step updates, and transparent issue reporting, with a human and conversational personality.
- **Autonomous AI System**: SySop is equipped with self-testing (Playwright), web search (Tavily API), vision analysis (Claude Vision), and architectural guidance. It features an automatic reflection loop, a server-side self-correction protocol, and autonomous troubleshooting. Human intervention points are defined for API keys, ambiguous requirements, and after failed fix attempts.
- **GitHub Integration for Platform Modifications**: Owner-controlled maintenance mode allows SySop to commit platform changes directly to GitHub on production. When enabled, platform file modifications create GitHub commits that trigger Render auto-deployment, solving ephemeral filesystem limitations. Requires GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPO, GITHUB_BRANCH environment variables and owner authentication.
- **Secrets Management**: Zero-knowledge credential handling for API keys.
- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: SySop can build complex marketplace platforms, professional-grade 2D/3D games, implement Orb usage-based billing, self-test, search documentation, and analyze visuals (including pasted screenshots).
- **Command System**: Natural language commands are processed by Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate project structures as JSON.
- **File Management**: Generated files are stored in PostgreSQL, viewable and editable via a file browser and Monaco editor.
- **Conversational AI**: An AI assistant powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet clarifies questions and explains design decisions, with automatic conversation summarization for memory optimization.
- **Preview System**: Uses `esbuild` for in-memory React/TypeScript compilation to show actual compiled/running applications in an iframe, with real-time status and auto-refresh.
