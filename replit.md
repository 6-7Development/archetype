# Lomu - "When Code Throws You Lemons"

## Overview
Lomu is an AI-powered platform for rapid web development, featuring an AI coding agent (LomuAI) for autonomous code generation and dual-version IDE Workspaces (Lomu for desktop, Lomu5 for mobile). It offers a console-first interface, real-time preview, and comprehensive workspace features. The platform aims for production readiness with portable deployment, monetization infrastructure, a template marketplace, and professional development services. A core capability is LomuAI's autonomous self-healing, bug fixing, and UI/UX improvements to its own source code, complete with rollback and audit logging.

## System Architecture
The platform is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

### Dual-Version Architecture
The platform utilizes a unified codebase to support two distinct user experiences: Lomu (Desktop) with a 4-panel layout, and Lomu5 (Mobile) with bottom tab navigation. Both versions share backend APIs, WebSocket connections, authentication, and database access.

### UI/UX Decisions
The user interface features a tab-based workspace providing an IDE-like experience, primarily through a command console and real-time live preview. The design emphasizes a fresh, optimistic aesthetic with a citrus-inspired color palette, card-based layouts, warm shadows, smooth transitions, and ADA/WCAG accessibility. Chat interfaces feature Lumo the Lemon mascot as an AI companion with natural sprite animations and emotional expressions. Loading states use a signature lemonade jar animation.

### Parallel Subagent Execution
LomuAI supports parallel subagent orchestration, allowing multiple tasks to execute simultaneously with Railway-safe resource limits. Tasks are queued, and progress is broadcast via WebSockets.

### Technical Implementations
- **AI Architecture**: LomuAI v2.0 follows a strict 7-phase workflow (ASSESS → PLAN → EXECUTE → TEST → VERIFY → CONFIRM → COMMIT) with programmatic enforcement via WorkflowValidator. Features include real-time streaming, usage-based billing, self-testing (Playwright), web search (Tavily API), vision analysis (Claude Vision), architectural guidance (I AM Architect), and an automatic reflection/self-correction loop.
- **Autonomous AI System (LomuAI v2.0)**: LomuAI diagnoses issues, implements fixes, and automatically commits changes to GitHub, triggering auto-deployment. It prioritizes tool execution and code writing, using a PostgreSQL-backed job queue for asynchronous execution with WebSocket broadcasting and checkpointing.
- **Developer Tools**: LomuAI includes 56 tools covering core operations, deployment, secrets management, database, design, integrations, and file operations. All tools include security sandboxing, WebSocket event streaming, and integrate with existing platform healing infrastructure.
- **Platform Healing System**: Complete self-healing infrastructure with 3-tier intelligent routing for cost-optimized incident resolution: Tier 1 (Knowledge Base Auto-Fix), Tier 2 (LomuAI v2.0/Gemini 2.5 Flash), and Tier 3 (I AM Architect/Claude Sonnet 4). Automatic response quality monitoring triggers I AM Architect for autonomous diagnosis and fixes when quality is low.
- **LomuAI v2.0 Workflow Enforcement**: Achieves Replit Agent behavioral parity through dual-layer enforcement: an enhanced system prompt with strict 7-phase workflow rules and a WorkflowValidator State Machine for programmatic runtime enforcement.
- **Real-Time Enforcement System**: A 6-layer real-time enforcement system fully integrated into lomuJobManager validates LomuAI responses and triggers I AM Architect guidance when violations occur.
- **Real-Time LomuAI + I AM Teamwork**: I AM Architect intervenes during active LomuAI sessions when workflow rules are violated, injecting corrective guidance. A "3-Strikes Escalation" policy automatically escalates jobs to I AM Architect for complete takeover after three failed guidance attempts.
- **Critical Files Protection System**: Implemented read-before-write enforcement for 8 core infrastructure files (server/index.ts, server/routes.ts, server/db.ts, server/vite.ts, package.json, drizzle.config.ts, vite.config.ts, shared/schema.ts) with file size change detection to prevent accidental overwrites.
- **Critical Bug Chain Resolution (Nov 5, 2025)**: Fixed 3 interconnected bugs preventing LomuAI from functioning:
  1. **Tool Name Mismatch** ([commit 463990f](https://github.com/6-7Development/archetype/commit/463990f36efcd03de2cf6e01e8c2e7bc0234bab1)): System prompt told LomuAI to call `createTaskList()` (camelCase) but actual tool was `create_task_list()` (snake_case) → silent failures → no task lists created. Fixed in server/lomuSuperCore.ts.
  2. **Phase Transition Blocking** ([commit 39bc896](https://github.com/6-7Development/archetype/commit/39bc896cebb3aa44aedb927e20bb81cd63a47162)): Two competing WorkflowValidator classes used different case (lowercase 'plan' vs uppercase 'PLAN') → ALL phase transitions failed → tools blocked → zero mutations → token waste. Fixed case mismatch in server/services/lomuJobManager.ts by converting detected phases to uppercase.
  3. **Raw HTML in Chat UI**: Enhanced frontend filter in client/src/pages/platform-healing.tsx to remove leaked HTML/JSX tags, escaped newlines, and JSON fragments from chat responses.
  
  **Combined Impact**: Task lists now work, phase transitions succeed, tools execute properly, and chat UI is clean with no raw code leaking.
- **Command System**: Natural language commands processed by Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate JSON project structures.
- **File Management**: Generated files are stored in PostgreSQL, editable via Monaco editor, with real-time WebSocket synchronization.
- **Preview System**: Uses `esbuild` for in-memory React/TypeScript compilation for live application previews in an iframe.
- **Multi-Agent Task Management System**: Foundation for autonomous task breakdown with database tables and LomuAI tools, supporting sub-agents, message queues, autonomy controls, and dynamic intelligence.
